            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <p>As for the English translated Bibles, they cannot be the only ground and rule of Faith. First, because they are not infallible, for neyther were they written in this language immediatly, neither were the translatours therof assisted by the holy Spirit infallibly: for the ministers themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that in their translation they might erre, being men. Sith therfore the translatours as being but men, may erre, how can a simple vnlearned man be infallibly sure that this particular translation which he hath, doth not erre?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the English Bibles cannot be the rule of faith because they are obscure and hard to be vnderstood, at least by vnlearned men, who cannot read them: and therefore they can not be a sufficient rule to instruct all men, in all points of fayth. For vnlearned men must needs be saued, but they cannot be saued without an entiere and infallible faith, which they cānot haue without some rule or meanes meet for their capacity to teach them the same, which rule in no wise can be the English Bibles, seeing they cannot read, much lesse vnderstand the same. Yea the learnedst men cannot by only reading the Scriptures in whatsoeuer language be infallibly sure that they rightly vnderstand them: for whilst they vnderstand one way, perhaps they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176665:8"/> ought to vnderstood another way: and that which they vnderstand plainly and litterally, ought perhaps to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood figuratiuely and mystically: and contrary, that which they vnderstand figuratiuely, ought perhaps to be vnderstood playnly and properly. Seeing then, that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are diuers, according to the diuers opinions of men, how shall any man be sure, which is the right exposition, hauing nothing to assure him, but his owne sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which is vncertayne and fallible, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be this rule of fayth, which we search for.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the English or Scottish Bibles cannot be the Rule of Fayth, because they are not vniuersall, that is to say, able absolutly to resolue all doubts and questions, which either haue bene, are presently, or may herafter come in Controuersy: for there be diuers questions and doubtes moued now a dayes, and those also touching very substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall matters, which are not expressely set downe, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by only Scripture. For where haue we any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture sufficient to proue, that al those, &amp; only those bookes which Catholikes or Puritās hold for Scripture, are indeed Gods Word, &amp; true Scripture? This we shall not find set downe in any part of Scripture. So as it is euident that the English Bibles cannot be the infallible rule of our Faith.</p>
                     <p>Finally because the ignorant who doe not vnderstand the Greeke and Hebrew, connot discerne infallibly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the English Bible be well translated or no; yea many Ministers, not being skillfull in the said Greeke &amp; Hebrew languages, cannot be infallibly sure of the English transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Some obiect that place of S. Paul,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        <hi>All Scripture is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by inspiration of God, and is proffitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for instruction in righteousnes, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished vnto all good workes.</hi> But it proueth nothing for them. Because it sayth not, that the Scripture is alone sufficient to instruct a man to perfection, but that it is profitable for this purpose. For there is a great difference betwixt a thing that is proffitable, and a thing that is fully and only sufficient. For example, Stones and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176665:9"/> Timber be profitable to the building of a house, yet they are not of thēselues fully &amp; only sufficient to build a house, for the hand of a skilfull workeman to prepare them, and set them together in order, is also required.</p>

Because all their consequences wit, and learning, be they neuer so exquisite and rare, are humane, naturall, and fallible; and therfore cannot be a sufficient foundation, whereupon to build a diuine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Faith; seing it can haue no more certainty, then the wit &amp; learning of man, who proponeth it, which is subiect both to deceaue, and be deceaued; according to the saying of the Apostle,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p>Besides, this Rule of Fayth must be able to propose to vs infallibly, not only the letters, and sense that seeme true to vs, but the very true sense of Gods Word intended by the holy Ghost, who is the author of this Word.

                     <head type="sub">That the priuate Spirit of euery Minister, is not the Ground or Rule of Fayth.</head>
                     <p>NO priuate man who persuadeth himselfe to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly instructed by the Spirit (as the most part of our inspired Puritans doe) can be this rule of fayth, in so farre forth as he belieueth, or teacheth contrary to the generall doctrine of the Catholike Church. First, because S. Paul sayth:<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, because the rule of Fayth must be infallible, such as this priuat spirit is not. For whosoeuer vaunteth himselfe to haue this Spirit, is not infallibly sure that he hath the same in particular, much lesse can assure others in points of Faith: for it is impossible for him to proue by any passage of Scripture an infallible assurance that he is taught by the holy Spirit, neyther by naturall reason can the same be verified. For albeyt he find in himselfe extraordinary motions, illuminations, feelings, and such like (of which those high spirited Brethren do much boast,) yet neyther by Scripture, nor reason, can he infallibly conclude, that those motions are of God, because the Scripture most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth,<note n="(b)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>

                        <hi>Going about like a roaring lyon seeking whome he may deuoure.</hi> Wherfore the safest way were to try these Spirits by the touchestone of the true Pastours of the Catholike Church, who may say with S.

                        <hi>We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth vs, he that is not of God, doth not heare vs. In this we know the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of errour.</hi> Now if men will not admit this manner of trying and discerning the Spirit of truth, from the Spirit of errour, but wil trust to their owne iudgement alone in this matter they may be sure that in their thoughts they worship the Angell of darknes, insteed of the Angell of light, which doing will be the cause of their endles damnation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this priuate Spirit cannot be the rule of faith, because it is variable &amp; vnconstant, &amp; is subiect to errour: first in euery person and company of men in particular; for our Aduersaries themselues confesse that they may erre, &amp; experience teacheth vs, that they oftentymes change their opinions, teaching whyles one thing, whiles another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne fantasie. Secondly, it is manifestly subiect to errour, seeing that all men challenge this Spirit. For if a man were bound to belieue all those that affirme themselus to haue the Spirit, of necessity he would belieue infinite contradictions. For the Lutherans, Caluinists, Brownists, Puritanes and the rest of that holy band, all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that they haue this Spirit, notwithstanding the great difference that is betwixt them, shewes that they haue not all the same selfe Spirit. For there is but one holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, which whilest euery one chalenges to himselfe, he doeth great iniury to the Church of God, to whom the infallible assistance of holy Spirit was promised,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:176665:10"/> and not to euery one in particular. Neyther is there any of those new spirited Gospellers that can shew any good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why they rather haue the true Spirit, then their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But suppose one could assure himselfe, that he were taught by Gods Spirit immediatly what is the true fayth in all points, in such sort, that he could erre in none, (as it is not the māner of God to teach men immediatly by himself alone, or by an Angell, for<note n="(g)" place="margin">

What arguments should he vse against others, that sayes they haue the same Spirit?</p>
                     <p>It may be he wil alledg that general promise of Scripture<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>
                        <hi>Euery man that seeketh, receaueth.</hi> He will say, that hauing sought earnestly for the true Spirit, he hath infallibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the same. But I answere, that this promise of our Sauiour is to be vnderstood in this manner: Euery mā that seeketh things lawfull to be sought, in due time and place, and according to the pleasure of God, &amp; profitable to their owne saluation, receaueth the same. Otherwise it cometh to passe that, as S. Iames sayth,<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Iames</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3.</note>
                        <hi>They aske and receaue not, because they aske wrongly.</hi> So that to haue sought this Spirit in prayer, is no sure signe to haue obteyned the same, seeing that there is no heretike, but he will affirme, that he hath sought for, yea and therefore obteyned the spirit: albeyt by the contraryeties betwixt him and his brethren it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that eyther he, or they, or both must be destitute of the true Spirit: For<note n="(l)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 13.</note>
                        <hi>God is not the author of contention, but of peace.</hi> What assurāce then can we haue that their new Gospellers and Fathers of new opinions haue the true spirit? Forsooth they will giue you a marke or token as vncertayne, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:176665:11"/> to be known, as the Spirit it selfe. Yee may be assured say they, that they haue the true Spirit, who preach nothing but the pure written word of God, euer still, for euery poynt of doctrine, alledging Scripture. But this their marke cannot be sufficient; for first, insteed of Scripture they bring forth their own translations in many places corrupted, and subiect to errour as translated by men. Secōdly, albeit they did alwayes alledge the true words of Scripture, yet they are not certayne that at all times, &amp; in all points of doctrine they alledge them rightly.

                     <p>Wherefore there is no reason whereby we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that such men haue the Spirit of God: but we may find many reasons to conuince them that they haue not this Spirit; yea the only particularity and priuatnesse of their Spirit is sufficient to mooue to suspect it, &amp; to assure vs that it is not the Spirit of truth.

We proue then, that this Rule of Fayth can be no other, then the doctrine, and teaching of the true Church, or company of the true faythfull of Christ. Because if our Sauiour Christ hath promised to any company of men, the presence of himselfe, who it truth it selfe, and the assistance of his holy Spirit, of purpose to instruct and teach them al truth, giuing withall peculiar charge and commission to them to teach all nations, and to preach to euery creature; giuing also warrant to all men that they may safely heare them; giuing also Commaundement, whereby he bindeth all, to do in al things according to their saying; and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning greatly those who will not heare and belieue them: Then certaynly the doctrine and teaching of those men is in all poynts most true, and such as may well be proposed to all sorts, as an assured ground, wherupon they may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely build an infallible Christian fayth.

                     <p>But so it is that our Sauiour hath promised, giuen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, warranted, commanded, and threatned in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforesayd: Therfore we cannot doubt but there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne company (the which is called the true Church of Christ, which both is in all points of fayth infallibly taught by the holy spirit, and is likewise to teach all sorts of men in all points of Fayth, what is the infallible truth; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the teaching of this company may well be assigned &amp; proposed to all men, as a sufficient Rule of Fayth, and as a <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Now, let vs proue euery part of this conclusion out of the written word of God.

For although our Sauiour in this place, doth only in expresse words make mention of the chayre of Moyses, in which the Priests of the old Law did sit; yet he is to be vnderstood to speake also of the chayre of S. Peter, in which the Priests of the new Law do succeed. Because we may rather thinke that our Sauiour intended in his doctrine to giue Rules to the Priests and people of his new Law, which was presently to beginne,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176665:13"/> and to continue, till the worlds end; then only to giue documents to those of the old Law, which were shortly to cease. And this to be the true sense of that place, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin testifyeth:<note n="(g)" place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>165.</hi>

                        <hi>He that will not heare the Church, account him as an Ethnick and publican.</hi> Finally after he had giuen charge &amp; commission to preach the Gospell, he pronounceth this threat against those that will not belieue:<note n="(k)" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>By these testimonies it is euident that it appertayneth to the Church to instruct vs in all points of Fayth, and that of it we ought to learne in all matters of Religion, what is the infallible truth; and consequently it is manifest, that the doctrine of this Church is the rule of Fayth.

                     </p>
                     <p>Therfore I conclude, that neither the writtē Word alone, nor consequences drawen out of the same, nor naturall wit, and learning, nor the priuate Spirit, nor any thinge els, except only the teaching of the true Church of Christ, is the ordinary meanes which God hath prouided, wherby all men may learne that one, infallible, entiere Faith, which is necessary to saluation.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That this Church, or Company of men, must be Visible.</head>
                     <p>THis is proued first, because the Church is Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but the body of Christ was visible, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle spake to visible men when he sayd:<note n="(a)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>7.</note>
                        <hi>Yee are the body of Christ.</hi> Moreouer we are made the body of Christ by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the reccauing of our Lords body, as the Apostle testifieth. Also in this body of Christ, there are doctours &amp; Pastours vntill the Consumation of Saintes, vntill we meet with Christ, but such persons are also visible. The buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding also of the Church is visible, the consumatiō of Saints is visible, the worke of ministry is visible, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayth shall continue vntill the coming of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this Church is the Kingdome of Christ, but euery kingdom comprehendeth in it a visible company of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176665:14"/> subiects that obey one king. Hence it is that Ieremy sayth:<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ierem.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 32.</note>
                        <hi>Euen as the starres of heauen cannot be numbred, and the sands of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of my seruant Dauid, and the Leuits my seruants:</hi> but such and so great a multitude of men cannot be inuisible. In like manner the Prophet I say describing the sayd kingdome of Christ, and the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God with it, sayth thus:<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>
                        <hi>I will make a perpetuall league with them, and their seed shall be knowen in all nations, and their of-spring in the midst of people; all that shall see them, shal know them, because this is the seed that God hath blessed.</hi> Where he saith manifestly, that all nations, euen the Infidels, assoone as they shall behold and see the Church, they shall easely know her, by the benefits of God bestowed vpon her. This kingdom also is cōpared to the Sunne &amp; full Moone which are very visible planets, and easy to be seene of all men.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Church is a Citty which is scituate vpon high mountayne, which is placed vpon the top of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, the which our Lord will strengthen for euer, whereof Christ himselfe sayth:<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>
                        <hi>A Citty placed vpon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne cannot be hid.</hi> Christ therefore hath made this Church not to hide it, but that it might be cleere &amp; manifest. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Augustin sayth:<note n="(e)" place="margin">Augu. tom. <hi>9.</hi> in ep. Ioan tract. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>What more shall I say, but that they are blind who doe not see so great a Mountayne, who shut their eyes agaynst a candle placed vpon a candlestick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the Church were inuisible, in vayne should we say in our beliefe, <hi>I belieue the Catholike,</hi> or vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church: for if the Church be vniuersal &amp; spread abroad ouer the whole world, she cannot be but very visible as also we shalbe forced to deny another article of our beliefe; to wit, <hi>The Communion of Saints,</hi> vnlesse the sayd Saints be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; manifest one to another, seeing that this Communiō, as the Apostle saith, consisteth in the continual help, which one mēber maketh to another; but help cannot be made to one that is not visible. Therfore the Church and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints must be visible.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, our Sauiour hath ordained this Church to be the light of the world, according as he sayth:<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>
                        <hi>Yee are the light of the world:</hi> and to be a rule or meanes wherby all men, at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176665:14"/> all times, may come to the knowledg of that one infallible &amp; entiere fayth, which is necessary to saluation. But how can it be the light of the world, if it be inuisible? How can it be a meanes wherby men shall know the truth, if it cannot be seeene nor knowne? If we say it fayled, we must then also say, that all that tyme men wanted sufficient meanes to attayne to the knowledge of the truth, and so were desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the true way to come to their saluation: which if it were true, of necessity it would follow that God should haue permitted men to be destitute of meanes necessary to their saluation, and so suffred them to be damned, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the saying of holy Scripture:<note n="(g)" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note>
                        <hi>God would haue all men saued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Wherefore to verify that God would haue all men saued, we must needes say that he hath prouided a necessary meanes for all men, by which they may come to the knowledge of true fayth, and therby to saluation: which meanes is a visible Church, of which they must heare &amp; learne the true fayth. Therfore the Church must alwayes be visible.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, if the vniuersall Church of Christ should for any space be inuisible, it should for that space cease to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse outwardly that fayth, which in hart it did belieue: for if it did outwardly professe, it would haue bene visible; if it did not professe, then hell gates did preuayle against it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs owne promise.</p>
                     <p>Seauenthly, if the Church were inuisible, we could not fulfill the commandment of Christ, wherin he sayd:<note n="(h)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17.</note>
                        <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> For how can we tell the Church any thing, if we know not how, nor where to find it? Neither if by chāce we did meet it, could we know it, to be the Church.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, it is certayne that once the true Church of Christ was visible, to wit, when it began first in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in the Apostles and Disciples of our Sauiour, and in that number, which by their preaching was conuerted to the Christian Fayth. But there can no reason be shewed why it should be visible then, and not euer since.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, the chiefe ground and reason why the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes hold the Church to be inuisible is, because they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:176665:15"/> the Church to consist only of the elect, or only of the good: But this ground is false, as appeareth by the name of the Church, in greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifieth, not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the elect or chosen, but a company that is called: so that in it are both good and bad, for as our Sauiour sayth:<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth</hi> 20 <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Math.</hi> 3. <hi>v</hi> 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22 <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13 <hi>v.</hi> 47. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note>

                     <p>As for testimonies of the Fathers, there is nothing more plainly expressed by them, thē this visibility of the Church.

The way then to find out this Church is first to set downe, which be the certayne markes whereby the true Church is knowen; next to examine, to what company those marks doe agree.</p>
                     <p>It is therfore to be noted. First, that a true mark cannot

Secondly, it must be more euidēt and easy to be knowen, then the thing which it signifieth. Wherfore, when we will assigne some good markes, by which all sorts of men may in some sort discerne which particular company of men is the true Church: we must haue speciall regard to assigne those things which in some manner may be apparent to all sorts of men, since all sorts of men haue need to seeke out, &amp; according to their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty discerne which is the true Church. We must also assigne those things, which are known to agree to the true Church at this tyme, and to no other company, but that which is the true Church, to the intent, that a man seeing all those things, which be assigned as markes, to agree to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he may straightwayes conclude, that company to be the true Church: as on the contrary side, if he perceaue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, or any of them to be wanting in any company, he may be sure, that that company is not the true Church.</p>

These I say, are not true marks. For first, by the true Fayth and preaching of the word, they eyther meane true doctrine in some points or els in all. If they meane true doctrine in some points only, it is no good marke: For heretiks teach the truth in some points. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not proper only to the Church, and so can be no marke therof. If they meane true doctrine in all points, it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176665:16"/> not sufficient, because it wanteth the second condition, to wit, it is not easy to be knowne, because it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a very learned man to examine if that doctrine were true in all points, as also that he were assisted with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assurance of Gods Spirit, least in his examination and tryall of his doctrine he should erre. As for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is very hard for a man of himselfe to iudge which vse of Sacraments is right, if he be not first taught by the Church. Therfore it is necessary before he know the right vse of the Sacraments, that he know the Church, which is more easy to find out, as being that direct way wherof <hi>Isay</hi> speaketh:<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>
                        <hi>This shall be to you a direct way, so that euen fooles may not erre in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, their two markes are not sufficient. Because when we seek for the true Church, we seek it principally to the end, that by it, as by necessary and infallible meanes, we may heare and learne of it the true Faith in all points, which otherwise in it selfe is hidden and obscure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that saying of S. Paul:<note n="(b)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>
                        <hi>The sensuall man doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue those things which are of the Spirit of God.</hi> For sith none by the only power of naturall wit, can obteyne the superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall knowledge of diuine mysteries which we belieue by our Fayth, neyther doth the Spirit of God now adayes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily instruct any man in the knowledge of true Fayth immediatly by himselfe, or by an Angell sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: we must needes if we will haue true Fayth, seek it by that meanes that God hath ordayned: which meanes is no other then the teaching of the true Church, according to S. Paul his saying:<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>
                        <hi>How shall they belieue him whome they haue not heard? How shall they heare without a preacher? How shall they preach vnles they be sent?</hi> Therfore the true Church, which only hath preachers truly sent of God, must first be found out, that by it we may heare and know which is the true Fayth. Therfore this marke of Faith is no wise sufficient to discerne the true Church by, yea rather contrary, the true Church is a marke wherby we may know the true Fayth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, true Fayth is included in the true Church, &amp; as it were inclosed in her belly, as S. Augustine sayth:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176665:16"/>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Aug. in Psal. <hi>57.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>Truth remayneth in the belly of the Church, from which whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is separate must needs speake false.</hi> Therfore, like as if a man had gold in his belly, we must first find the man, before we can come to see the gold it selfe; so we must first by other markes find out the true Church, which hath the gold of true Fayth hidden in her belly, before we come to see to gold of true Fayth it self; sith specially we cannot see it, vnlesse she open her mouth and deliuer it vnto vs; neyther can we certaynly know it to be true, and not coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfayte, but by giuing credit to her testimony of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of S. Augustine:<note n="(e)" place="margin">Augu. lib. con. ep. Fund. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>I would not belieue the Ghospell it selfe, except I were moued therto by the authority of the Church.</hi> For if we had not the authority of the Church, how should we be infallibly sure that there were any gospell at all? Or how should we haue knowen that some books are Gospell and others not?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the true doctrine of Fayth in all particular poynts must be first knowen, as a marke wherby to know the true Church: then (contrary to that which before we proued) the authority of the Church should not be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary meanes wherby men must come to the knowledge of the true Fayth. For if before we come to know which is the true Church, we must by other meanes haue knowne which is the true Fayth: what need is there for to find out true Fayth which already we haue, to bring in the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the true Church?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, if before we giue absolute and full credit to the true Church, we must examine and iudge whether euery particular point of doctrine which it holdeth, be the truth, with authority or liberty to accept only that which we like or which seemeth in our conceyt right and conformable to Scripture, and to reiect whatsoeuer we mislike, or which in our priuate iudgement seemeth not so right and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, then we make our selues examiners and iudges ouer the Church, and consequently we preferre our lyking or dislyking, our iudgement of the interpretation and sense of Scriptures, before the iudgement of the Church of God. But it is absurd both in reason and Religion to preferre one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176665:17"/> priuate mans iudgement, to the iudgement and sentence of the whole Church of God, which is a company of men for the most part vertuous, wise &amp; learned, &amp; which vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly hath the holy Spirit to guide them in all truth, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to erre.</p>
                     <p>But some man will say, that the Scripture forbiddeth vs to belieue euery Spirit, but to try the Spirits if they be of God, therfore we must examine the Spirit of the Church, by examining in particular the doctrine thereof. I answere, that in that place of Scripture, it is not meant, that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to euery man to try all Spirits, but generally the Scripture warne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h the Church, not to accept of euery one that boasteth himselfe to haue the Spirit, and willeth those Spirits to be tryed: not that euery simple and vnlearned man should take vpon him to try them, but that those of the Church, to whome it apperteyneth to try Spirits, should do the same, to wit the Doctours &amp; Pastours which God hath placed in his Church, to the end we may not be caried away with euery wind of Doctrine, &amp; that we may not be lyke litle ones, wandring with euery blast of those that boast themselues to be particularly taught by the Spirit. So that this trying of Spirits, is only meant of those Spirits, of which men may well doubt whether they be of God or no, and then this tryall belōgeth to the Pastours of the true Church. But when it is certayne that the Spirit is of God, we neyther need nor ought doubtfully to examine, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously iudge of it; but submitting obediently the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of our owne sense and reason, we must belieue the teaching of it in euery point. Now we haue sufficiētly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before out of the writtē word, that the Spirit of the true visible Church is of God: Therfore our only care should be to seeke out those markes by which all men may know, which particular company of men is the true Church of Christ, whose doctrine we neither need, nor lawfully may examine in doubtfull manner, but must obediently and vndoubtedly in all points belieue, as the only assured and infallible truth, which is to be belieued by Christians.</p>

This vnity our Sauiour affirmeth to be a speciall token wherby to know his Church, when he saith:<note n="(i)" place="margin">

                        <hi>In this shall all men know that yow are my Disciples, if you loue one another.</hi> Thirdly, there is an vnity betwixt the faythfull people and their Pastours by obedience, which whosoeuer breaketh, is also a Schismatike. This vnity the Apostle commandeth to be kept, when he sayth:<note n="(k)" place="margin">

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is most manifest that the Protestants Congregation is not the true Church of Christ, because the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per marks aboue rehearsed do in no wise agree vnto it. As by the contrary the Roman Church is proued to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Church, because in it only are to be found the sayd markes. First then it is cleere, that the Protestants Church can in no wise be called <hi>One,</hi> such as the true Church should be. For in the Protestants Church there is no vnity im mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fayth, as fully in the first Consideration is declared; it being very hard to find three of them in all points of one mynd and opinion. Neyther haue they any meanes to end their controuersies, and to returne to vnity and continue therein. For while they admit no rule of Fayth, but only the Bible, which euery one according to his fantasie doth expound, not submitting themselues to any one superiour guyded by the holy ghost to the end that all occasion of cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies &amp; diuision may be taken away: while, I say, they do thus, it is impossible that they should all agree in one Fayth and beliefe.</p>
                     <p>Contrarywise, the Roman Church is alwayes <hi>One,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer changing any poynt of Doctrine, contrary to that which from the beginning it did belieue. Yea if at any time any controuersy cōcerning any point of Doctrine do arise, the same is easily ended, in respect that the Roman Church doth acknowledge one chiefe Pastour, appointed for that end by our Sauiour Christ Iesus, who commaunded all Christians to obey the same Church.

                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Roman Church, it cannot be denyed, but in it some sinfull folks are mixt with the good, as in the ninth Consideration is aboundantly declared. Yet betwixt the sinfull in the Roman Church, and those among Heretiks, there are two differences. The first is, that there are none among Heretikes which may truely be called <hi>Holy,</hi> from whome, as from the better part, their congregation may be named <hi>Holy.</hi> For albeyt we find some among them who absteyne from sinnes most apparent to the eyes of man, as stealing, swearing, and such lyke, and who do exercise some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176665:21"/> morall workes, as giuing of almes, liuing temperatly and moderatly &amp;c. Yet those are not sufficient signes of <hi>Holinesse,</hi> because the same, &amp; much more was practised by the heathē Philosophers, and did proceed rather of naturall wit, and learning, then of charity and deuotion, in which true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse doth consist: For as S. Paul sayth:<note n="(c)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 3.</note>
                        <hi>Although a man bestow all his goods to feed the poore, and giue his body to be burned, yet not hauing Charity it should profit him nothing.</hi> Which Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must proceed<note n="(d)" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</note>
                        <hi>out of a pure heart, and good conscience, &amp; an vnfained Faith.</hi> Which things because they are inwaid, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to be knowē, except it please God to reueale them by miracle, or some other certayne way to vs. But hertofore it hath not bene heard that <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Caluin,</hi> or any of their followers confirmed by miracles their fayned holynesse, but rather it pleased God, by giuing euil successe to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, to shew that in thē there was no holinesse. Wheras in the Roman Church God hath euer giuen testimony by miracles, of the Fayth and holynesse of diuers Professours thereof, as the Protestants of Scotland must needes confesse of sundry of our holy Kings, as King <hi>Malcolme Kenmor,</hi> Queene <hi>Margaret,</hi> King <hi>William,</hi> King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and of others as <hi>S. Mongo, S. Ninian, S. Serfe, S. Padie, S. Columbane, S. Baldred, S. Patrike,</hi> whose miracles and holynesse of lyfe to this day are with one assent acknowledged in Scoland.</p>
                     <p>The second difference be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wixt the bad Catholiks &amp; best Protestants is, that the Protestant Doctrine doth lead the Protestants to all sort of liberty, as is notorious by the grounds of their Religion: wheras the Roman Fayth both expresly forbiddeth all vice, and prescribeth Lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to liberty and loosnes of life, and conteyneth most soueraygne meanes, to incite and mooue men to all perfect vertue and holynesse of life. So that those which be sinfull in the Roman Church, cannot in any sort ascribe their sins to any defect or want of the doctrine of the Church; but rather to their owne frailty or malice, contrary to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, and sometymes contrary to their owne conscience and knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Wherof it followeth, that albeyt there be some sinfull
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176665:22"/> men in the Roman Church, yet it may well be called <hi>Holy</hi> because the doctrine which it professeth, directeth &amp; lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to all holynesse, many of the professours thereof being most manifestly knowen to haue excelled in piety and good workes, whome God also of his infinite bounty hath vouchsafed to declare, by manifold and cleare miracles to haue bene holy.</p>

                     <p>THis Title in no wise can be applyed vnto the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Congregation, for it is not Catholike, neyther in time, in place, nor in doctrine. First for tyme, it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by themselues that Luther was the first preacher therof. Neyther can the Protestants shew by any good testimony, any one man or company, that did professe and belieue in all points those opinions, which since Luthers reuolt from the Catholike Church, they haue professed. Secondly for place, it is not vniuersall, for as before Luther and Caluin the Protestant Religion was not, so now presently there is no kingdome or nation that maketh wholly profession of Protestancy. Not England, wherein there are diuers Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, many of the Family of Loue, many Atheists, and of no Religion. Not Scotland, wherein likewise there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Puritans, yea many of the Bishops are Puritans in their hart, and likewyse many Atheists. Thirdly, for doctrine, it is not vniuersall, because their whole doctrine consisteth of negatiues, in denying diuers points which haue beene generally belieued in all former ages, as Purgatory praying to Saints, and such lyke: for which cause the Puritanes thinke the Protestant Pastours to be Antichristian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, by reason that Antichrist shall conteyne in his name 666. which number is wholly conteyned in the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Whereas on the contrairy side, the Roman Church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176665:22"/> may only take vnto it selfe as proper &amp; peculiar, the name of Catholike, both in tyme and place, it hauing been first planted and preached by the Apostles through the whole world, &amp; so still visibly vntill these our dayes hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and shall to the end of the world continue. And also hauing euer in all places, where there be any Christians, some visible professours of the same. As also it is vniuersall in doctrine, teaching in all points the selfe same doctrine which by lineall succession of Pastours it hath receaued from Christ and his Apostles. Wherefore let the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants who affirme that Christs Church hath erred, let them I say, shew in what age, vnder what Pope, by what way, with what violence and force, with what increase did a strange Religion ouerflow Rome, and the whole world? What speaches or rumors there were? What tumultes and troubles, what lamentations did such a nouelty breed?

                     <head type="sub">That euery man cannot be saued, of whatsoeuer Religion he make profession.</head>
                     <p>THere be many Libertines in Scotland, England, and Ireland, &amp; elswhere who do thinke foolishly that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may be saued in any kind of Religion: which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as it is most false and erroneous, so is it most foolish and dangerous, bringing a man thereby to acknowledge no Religion at all, which is the way &amp; path to Atheisme. The reason wherfore this opinion is most erroneous and false is, because in euery act of Fayth, we must not only regard what we doe belieue, but also (and that principally) vpon what ground and motiue we belieue it, or what is the reason of our beliefe. For of what kind the motiue, or reason of our beliefe is, of the same kynd is our Fayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, &amp; Religion. So that if the ground, motiue, or reason (called <hi>Ratio formalis Fidei</hi>) wherfore we beleeue any thing, be most certayne and infallible, our Fayth lykewise is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and infallible: if it be vncertayne, our Fayth also is vncertayne, fallible and subiect to errour, and consequēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not a <hi>diuine,</hi> but a <hi>humane Fayth.</hi> As for example: The Turke beleeueth, that there is one God, Creator of all things, because he is so taught by his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176665:25"/> thinketh (being persuaded by the inward Spirit, sayth he) to be written by the Spirit of God. But his fayth (albeyt he belieue that which is true) relyeth, and is grounded vpon a deceitfull reason and motiue, that is, vpon his <hi>Alcoran</hi> or false Bible, by the force whereof he is moued to belieue many false and blasphemous things, as, That there are not three persons in the Blessed Trinity, that Christ is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Mahomet, &amp; many such: wherfore that fayth of his by reason of the foundation and motiue is deceitful and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, leading a man to eternall damnation. Euen so the Protestants belieue:<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 27.</note>
                        <hi>That Christ his soule was put in the graue:</hi>

                        <hi>That Christ feared the paynes of hell;</hi> and many such heads of Religion, because they find (say they) those heads of Religion in the Bible translated by their owne Ministers, whome they must auow to haue erred in the translation thereof, and consequently must needes auow not to be the infallible word of God. For asmuch then as this their fayth relyeth vpon a deceitfull ground and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that is, vpon their corrupted Bible, not vpon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and sure ground, it cannot be diuine but humane Fayth. Hence I inferre this argument. That Fayth which relyeth vpon a false foundation and ground (albeyt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue somethings which are true) cannot be sufficient to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation or diuine Fayth. But the Fayth and Religion of sundry sectes and heresies of other ages, and of this our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted age relyeth vpon a false foundation. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sufficient to saluation.</p>
                     <p>As for example. The yeare of our Lord two hundreth,<note place="margin">Epip hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us lib. de mens. &amp; pond.</note> there were certaine Heretikes called <hi>Symmachians</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued the blessed Trinity, the true Messias, receaued the Scripture, and the Bible as the word of God, exponing it alwayes according to their owne fansie and priuat Spirit, but because they denyed or misbeleeued the day of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall iudgement, they were condemned as Heretykes by the Church of God. Because the ground and motiue of their Religion was not in effect the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but the word of God interpreted according to their owne fansie &amp; &amp; Imagination. Likewise the <hi>Valesians, Nouatians, Angeliques,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176665:26"/> Apostoliques</hi> receaued the Scripture as the word of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning the same according to their owne fansie, to proue therby their heresies and errours; yet because the ground &amp; last resolution of their Religiō was not in the true word of God, but rather in their owne fansie and imagination, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the consent of the vniuersall Church, they were condemned by the auncient Fathers, as Heretikes &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Diuell. Euen so it is with our Protestants, who belieue not the word of God, as it is precisely the word of God, but as it is viciously translated by the Ministers, and as it is erroneously explicated conforme to their owne fansie, and against the consent of the vniuersall Church of God, which hath bene these sixteene hūdreth yeares; which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I will mak more manifest by this argument. <hi>Those who belieue many heads of Religion which are not conteyned in the expresse word of God, and misbelieue other heads of Religion, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the expresse word of God; are not grounded in their beliefe vpon the only expresse word of God, or are not moued to belieue or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieue by the authority of the expresse word of God only, as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: But thus belieue the Ministers of Scotland and England.</hi> Ergo. I proue the <hi>Minor.</hi> The Ministers belieue. 1. That there be only two Sacraments. 2. That the supper of the Lord should be receaued with kneeling. 3. That the best worke a man can do, conteineth deadly sinne. 4. That children may be saued without Baptisme &amp;c. Which are no wise cōteyned in the expresse word of God: yet they misbelieue these heads of the Catholik Religiō. 1.<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                     <p>Of the which doctrine I inferre. First that the last resolution of the Protestant Religion is in one of these two grounds; first they belieue this or that to be a poynt of fayth because they find it (say they) in their corrupted Bible (thogh they shall neuer be able to proue any debarable poynt out of the expresse word of the Bible) belieuing neuerthelesse many other things which are not conteyned expressely in their owne corrupted Bible, but it cannot be a sincere faith which is groūded vpon such a corrupted Bible. 2. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue this or that head of Religion, not because it is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the word of God expressely, otherwise they would belieue all therin conteyned alyke, but because it pleaseth them to expone the expresse word of God to their fansie, and iudgement, which they call <hi>the inward persuasion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost;</hi> the which is the last <hi>Rendeuous,</hi> and resolution of the Protestants Religion, as the Hugenots in France wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse plainly in their confession of Fayth:<note n="(f)" place="margin">In the confession of Fayth of the Huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots in France. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. <hi>4.</hi>

                     <p>Notwithstanding all these most weighty and forcible Considerations, sundry Protestants through the liberty of their Freewil, and specially through want of pious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to imbrace the truth, for worldly respects, or fleshly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, doe not suffer their minds to consider earnestly (as the importance of the matter requireth) these forsayd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, doe not permit their will to make election of the true and sincere Religion, and that by reason of a preiudicate erroneous conceit, which is setled in their mind, with pride and obstinacy, which is common to all Heretikes; to which end the Ministers without any conscience inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the people with preiudicate and preocupied opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea blasphemies agaynst the Catholike Religion: as that the Catholikes adore Images, put all their trust in their good workes, pray to stocks and stones, and such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which were tedious to me to rehearse.

                     <p>FIrst of all, yow are to apprehend this mater of Religion as a point of great moment and importance, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon dependeth eternall felicity, and consequently yow should not read Controuersie-books eyther for curiosity, as many doe, or negligently and to passe your time only, nor with the Spirit of contradiction (which is familiar to the Protestants and Puritans) to find out faultes, and quarrell without iust occasion, the Catholikes sayings: But rather yow should read sincerely and in conscience making God himselfe the iudge of your reading, proposing for end only to find out the true Religion, the true fayth and profession for the sauing of your soules: for by this meanes you shall, as it were, oblige God to giue you light and assistance to discerne the true Religion from the false; which to obteyne you haue great need to be hūble in mind, deuout in praier, and indifferent to imbrace the truth only, to pray to God often, saying with the Prophet Dauid: <hi>O Lord teach me to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill thy will, because thou art my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When yow beginne to read any controuersy, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour first to apprehend well the true state of the Question, not belieuing one side only, but rather searching out what euery syde, Catholik &amp; Protestant holdeth therin, &amp; in this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:176665:31"/> poynt, besids many others, yow shall find amongst the Protestant-writers great fraud and deceit vsed, by reason that they propone the questions not sincerely as we Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes do hold and belieue them, but as they would haue the Reader vnderstand them to their owne aduantage. As for example: The Protestants propose that question thus, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man may be saued by workes without grace?</hi> Which is easy for the Protestants to impugne, by reason that it is false. But the true state of the question, and as the Catholikes do belieue it, is this: <hi>Whether by good workes that proceed from the grace of God, and true Fayth, a Christian may be saued?</hi> And so in all the rest, yow shall find great fraud amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant-writers in proposing the true state of the question, as yow shal see specially in <hi>M.

Where in his preamble to the same pag. 22. setting downe differences in doctrine betwixt the Catholik &amp; Protestant Church, is conuinced to haue made aboue an hundreth &amp; twēty lyes, in lesse then three leaues.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When yow haue found the true state of the Question, yow must be very carefull to hold the same continually in your mynd, considering attentiuely whether the discourse which yow shall read in your Author be to the purpose, &amp; doe leuell right at the marke or no, or runne aside to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent matters, as often yow shall find the Protestants to doe; and specially <hi>D. Whitaker</hi> in his controuersies, who doeth fill vp leaues with many wordes, but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, playing alwayes the Oratour, but not the Deuine &amp; Doctour. In lyke manner yow shall find many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant-writers in these our dayes who slip asyde, and will dryue yow into many by-matters to confound your iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and memory, weary your patience, and therby make all your reading unprofitable: and thus yow shall find in those Protestant-writers, who haue more words then wit, passion then learning, deceit then truth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Yow must remark diligently how that the Protestāt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:176665:31"/> writers doe promise nothing but <hi>Scripture,</hi> nothing but <hi>the pure word of God, the expresse words of the Bible;</hi> yet in effect yee shall find that they giue for Scripture, their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, for the word of God, their owne expositions, &amp; for the true text of the Bible, a most corrupted and falsified translation, as yow will see in the booke followinge. Moreouer you must remarke, that when the Protestants doe cite Scripture, and their owne corrupted Bible, you must consider I say, how that place cited by them was vnderstood and interpreted by auncient Fathers, of whome the Protestants themselues make great accompt, and who were many hundreth yeares before those our controuersies did aryse. As for example: We Catholikes doe alledge for proofe of <hi>purging fire</hi> after this lyfe, those words of S. Paul:<note n="(k)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</note> (<seg rend="sup">a</seg>) <hi>He shalbe saued, but so as by fire,</hi> as S. Augustin in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his workes witnesseth, and before him Origen, and after him S. Gregory, and sundry others. The Protestants agaynst <hi>Purgatory,</hi> alledge vpon their side the saying of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ecclesi.</hi> 11.</note>
                        <hi>Where the tree falleth, there it lyeth.</hi> No man shall find that this place was euer alledged in this sense by any auncient Father, which is so certayne and infallible, that the Protestants in citing the Scripture for their heresies &amp; opinions, cannot possibly name not only one auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hath interpreted those places of the Scripture as they doe, which sheweth the Protestāts to be manifest He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes in explicating the Scripture agaynst the streame and multitude of all the learned holy men, who were frō Christ to Luther his time, and since.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As for the holy Fathers themselues, when they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, it is to be considered in what age they wrote, and whether that which they say was euer found to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by other Fathers of that age, or after them. For whē no contradiction is found (though any Fathers sentence doth not make a matter fully <hi>de fide,</hi> or of necessity vnder payne of sinne, or heresie to be absolutly belieued,) it is a weighty and infallible proofe, that the thing which the Father affirmeth, was so belieued by the whole Church of God, in his dayes, and consequently it were great teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176665:32"/> not to belieue the same. As for example, S. Augustins <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>plication of the foresayd place, <hi>he shall be saued, but so as by fyre,</hi> in proofe of Purgatory, was neuer contradicted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Father of his age, yea or before or after him, which is an infallible marke that the fayth of the Catholike Church cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Purgatory was then vniuersally in vse, and before S. Augustine, yea and after him. And forasmuch as that Church and Religion which was in S. Augustines tyme, was, and is acknowledged by all to haue bene the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, it must needs be presumed to haue held no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing generally, which the Catholike knowne Church of the precedent age before S. Augustine did not also belieue and teach, and so from one age to another, vpward and downward may this demonstration be made, which ought to be a great motiue to any discreet and vnpassionate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Whereof the contrary is manifest in sundry expositions of the Scripture by Origen, Tertullian, and such, whose partiall and erroneous expositions were contradicted by those of their tyme, and after them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Yow must needes in lyke manner remarke the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing of the Protestants in writing and preaching: by reason that in generall, and publickly they will say and protest the holy and auncient Fathers to be of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of their Faith, and profession, to the end that they may bleare the eyes of the ignorant. But if any Catholike cite for him any manifest place in particular of any auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as of S. Augustine for Purgatory, &amp; praying to Saints in heauen, S. Ambrose for the Reall Presence, and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Masse, and such like; then yow shall see the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters answere that the holy Fathers were men, might erre, and lye, deceaue and be deceaued; as if the Ministers were not men, yea lying and erroneous men, since <hi>they can doe no good, say they, but continually, do transgresse Gods commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> teaching alway two seuerall sorts of doctrine, one in publicke the other in particular. In lyke manner when the holy Fathers are brought agaynst their damnable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will answere euer with shift and guyle, <hi>that there is no comparison betwixt the Fathers and the Scripture; that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176665:32"/> they should not be belieued except they bring Scripture with them.</hi> But if the Catholike aske Scripture of the Minister, and the expresse word of the Bible for his opinions, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being guilty, and certayne that he cannot proue any debatable poynt of his Religion by the expresse word, nor yet impugne any of our Religion, will giue yow, insteed of the expresse word of the Bible, his consequences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, that is, his owne expositions, explications, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious damnable heresies, and doctrines of the deuill, which he giueth and preacheth to the ignorant people, as if they were the word of God. After the same manner, if the Ministers alledge any places out of any auncient Father, founding to the fauour of any poynt of their Religion, if yow demand of them, whether they will stand absolutly to such a Fathers doctrine and determination in that, and all other controuersies which he handleth, they will refuse it assuredly. But we not, if it be a matter not censured by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Father, or by the holy Church at that tyme. As for example, when the Ministers do alledge S. Augustine agaynst <hi>Freewill,</hi> if yow aske them whether they will stand absolutly to S. Augustines iudgment in this poynt, and in all other poynts of controuersy betwixt vs and them, as <hi>Purgatory, Prayer to Saints, prayer for the dead &amp;c.</hi> they dare in no wise accept thereof: But we Catholikes haue no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to admit S. Augustin concerning all controuersed points. Finally if yow cite playne and manifest sentences of the Fathers agaynst Protestants, they will answere that they speake figuratiuely. Thus <hi>M. Andrew Ramsey</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of me, then in prison in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> whether S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine had not in his workes, sundry prayers directed to the Saints in heauen? he answered as a playne Atheist. That <hi>S. Augustine</hi> prayed <hi>per prosopopeiam.</hi> Could any Turke or Iew answere more Sophistically or Atheistically?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. By reason that the Controuersies be so many and the discourse so large vpon euery Controuersy, and the shifts so innumerable, it will be impossible for yow, to quyet and settle your iudgement by only reading of diuers books. And though it were possible for yow, yet it could
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176665:33"/> not be possible for thousands of others who cannot read, nor haue the commodity of books: for which cause you must haue a more sure and infallible rule, to find out the true Religion, then reading; which is, <hi>the Resolution</hi> of the vniuersall Christian Church in euery age concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. This is the only sure, short, and infallible way, to find out the true Religion: which way S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin teacheth and setteth down plentifully, in his booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Cresconius</hi> the heretike saying:<note n="(c)" place="margin">Lib. cont.

                        <hi>Quisquis falli metuit huius obscuritate Quaestionis, Ecclesiam de ea consulat.</hi> That is; <hi>Whosoeuer feareth to be deceaued by the obscurity of this Question, let him go, and aske the Church thereof.</hi> And this same infallible way our Sauiour commaunded vs to follow, when we are in doubt of any poynt of Religion, saying: <hi>Tell the Church of it: He that will not heare the Church, let him be to thee as a heathen and publican.</hi> For the which cause S. Augustin sayd wisely:<note n="(d)" place="margin">Cont. Epist. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>I truly would not belieue the Ghospell, except the authority of the Church did induce me therto.</hi> To which testimony of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin, I might ioyne the testimonyes of the holy Fathers, who with one consent doe appoint, as an infallible rule to find out the true Religion, to try and search diligently, <hi>which is the true Church.</hi> For, <hi>Seeing the Controuersies of Religion</hi> (sayth a Protestant in our tyme) <hi>are growen in number so many,</hi>

                     <p>HAuing set down at length the infallible meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may find out the true Religion, Church, and Profession: hauing lyke wise proued the true markes of the true Church, and those to be only proper to the Catholike and Roman Church, and consequently hauing proued that for the space of fifteene hundreth yeares the Protestants and Puritanes had no Church at all, no Religion, no Fayth, no outward profession knowen to God, or the world, yea no professours of their Religion except two, to wit, <hi>Nullus</hi> and <hi>Nemo,</hi> that is to say in truth, <hi>none at all:</hi> It followeth then of necessity, that the Protestants Religion before the comming of Caluin &amp; Luther was nothing els, but a plain Platonicall or Poeticall Chymera, that is a meere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fiction inuented by seditious Puritanes, to change the Politicall State (vnder the pretext of a reformed Religion) of Scotland, England and Ireland, that thereby they might more freely inuade the lands and possessions of Catholikes, take to their own vses the rents and temporall goods of the Church liuings, ouerthrow the auncient Nobility of those three auncient kingdomes, casting down their houses, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them from their natiue Countrey, imprisoning their persons, and vsing all sort of barbarity, which the furyes of hell could inuent, against them.</p>
                     <p>Now it followeth to set down in these sixteen follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages or Cēturies, first the names of the chiefe Pastors in euery Centurie, as being the principall members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church. 2. The names of the Kings of Scotland (the same is easy to be done of the Emperours, of the Kings of Frāce, England, Ireland, Spayne, Poland, Denmarke, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and other Princes, all Catholiks, who did raygne in all Christendom before the coming of Luther &amp; Caluin) who happily haue raygned &amp; professed the Catholike Religion to this our Age &amp; Century. 3. To set downe the doctrine,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176665:34"/> Fayth, and Religion of the most holy, famous, and learned Fathers, who were in euery age and Century, vsing the very words of those holy Fathers with all fidelity, that thereby the Catholike Reader may see manifestly, that the Catholike and Romane Religion (for the which we are now persecuted by the Protestants and Puritanes in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, England, and Ireland) is the selfe same Religion which was professed by the holy Apostles, &amp; which from them hath visibly without any interruption continued frō age to age to these our dayes. To which end I haue made choyce of twenty fyue articles of the Catholike Religion, which, (as the chiefest of all the rest) I proue first by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and good Reason, called <hi>probatio de iure.</hi> Then, by the consequences &amp; doctrine of the holy Fathers of euery age, called <hi>probatio de facto.</hi> Thirdly, I set downe the places of the Bible concerning those articles, falsified by the Ministers of Scotland and England. Finally, I shew, cleerly in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Protestants and Puritanes haue neyther for thē the expresse word of the Bible, nor the plaine text ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, eyther to proue any debatable point of their Religiō, or to improue any of ours; nor any groūd in the Scripture, not antiquity, nor succession, nor vnion, nor meanes to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the same; and finally that their Religion is nothing els but a meere inuention of the Ministers.</p>
                     <p>Now, I challenge the Protestants, if they can, to deuise &amp; set downe a catalogue sufficient to confront this of mine. I challenge them to set down the Professors of their Relgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in euery age, as I doe the Professours of our Catholike, and Roman Religion; to set down their very words, and &amp; plaine sentences faithfully: which they not being able to do, are obliged in conscience (if they haue any conscience) to auow plainly the truth in so weighty a poynt; that is, That they are childrē without Fathers, &amp; schollers without Maisters; That they are the first professours of this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, &amp; that they cannot name any professour of their Religion in all essential points, before Luther and Caluin, the former two alwaies excepted, <hi>Nullus</hi> and <hi>Nem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>OMnipotent, &amp; most mercifull God, wheras without true Fayth no man can be saued, or please thee, but comming vnto thee (as the Apostle sayth) he must belieue;<note place="margin">Ex S.

                        <p>Graunt O Lord, that I may follow &amp; imbrace that Faith only, which the holy, Catholike &amp; Roman Church doth teach &amp; professe; she being the pillar &amp; firmamēt of Verity, &amp; so guided &amp; grounded by thy holy Spirit, that in Faith and doctrine she cannot erre.</p>
                        <p>Giue me Grace, O Lord, that whatsoeuer shalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, &amp; consonant to this orthodoxe &amp; Catholike Faith, I may imbrace, and approue the same; &amp; detest &amp; abhorre what shall be contrary therunto: that al my works, words, &amp; deeds may be answerable to this Fayth, least by my bad life &amp; example, I may seeme to deny thee, whome with a true &amp; sincere Fayth I confesse.</p>
                        <p>Increase, O most mercifull Father, and so confirme this true Fayth in me, that neither man, nor diuell may be euer able to take the same away from me: but that both in word &amp; worke, I may alwayes professe, &amp; confesse the same; yea and if need be, to seale this truth with the sheeding of my bloud, and death it selfe, in testimony therof. Confirme O Lord God, this my will &amp; desire, through Christ Iesus thy only Sonne, &amp; our Iudge, who liueth and raygneth, with thee and the holy Ghost, in perfect Trinity, world without end. Amen.</p>

The chiefe professours, yea of our own Nation of Scotland, by which it hath been taught &amp; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. 3. I shew the pedegree of the Kings of Scotland, all Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, from Donald the first vntill B. Queene Mary the Martyr, our Gracious soueraygne his Mother, few other Mothers in our age being worthy of such a Sonne, few other Sonnes worthy of such a Mother. 4. I prooue by the Scripture twenty foure substantiall points of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth the rest being easily deduced out of those, &amp; the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which I prooue at length. 5. I chalenge the Ministers to improue any of those 24. articles, and to be contrary to the expresse word of the Bible, which they shall neuer be able to do. 6. I challeng them likewise to proue any one point of their Religion, as set downe in the expresse word of their own Bible, which being impossible for them to do, I force them to auow that they preach not the Bible, not the expresse word, not the Scripture, but their owne fancies, yea old rotten &amp; condemned he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, which they call their consequences drawne out of the Bible. 7. I set downe those same 24. substantiall points of our Catholike Religion proued by the holy Fathers of the first hundred yeares, putting downe most faithfully their owne words, sayings, &amp; consequences drawne out of the expresse word of the Bible; being a thing so notorious, that a man who hath any reason, iudgmēt, or vnderstanding, any feeling of God, or care of his conscience, should willingly prefer the consequences of these holy, wise, learned &amp; ancient Fathers before the stinking puddle of cōse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Ministers, who are children without Fathers, &amp; preachers without commission, or any warrant in the word of God 8. I shew how the ministers haue falsified the Bible in all those places which make for vs Catholiks against thē. Finally &amp; last of all, I proue that the Church of God in this &amp; the other ensuing Ages, was a known generation, society &amp; congregation of Pastours &amp; people, Parents &amp; Children, Heades and members successiuely propagated &amp; iointly vnited without interruptiō one frō the other; which must needs still perseuere constant &amp; faithful, what opposition soeuer be made against it. And on the contrary I shew, that the Ministers of Scotlād, England, or Ireland can shew no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
<pb facs="tcp:176665:39"/> of their religion, no not one before Luther &amp; Caluin, who do agree with them in all essentiall points of fayth, concluding therby that they are vnkind slipps grafted by Sathan, of whom the Wiseman saith:<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <p>Consider Christian Reader I pray thee, if in the case of some tēporall State any Lord or Earle of Scotland to prooue the tytle of the lands he holds, should produce the publike sentence, not only of all the Iudges of Scotland for the space of fourteen hundred yeares, but of all the world for the space of fifteen hundred years: the sentence, I say, iudicially deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the presence of all those Kinges, &amp; of the three Estates of all those Christian Kingdomes in fauour of the true Possessour of the land, condē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the aduerse party of imposture &amp; intrusion: &amp; this their decision, sentence &amp; condemnation in diuers recordes amongst the publike mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents not only of that one Kingdom, but likwise of the whole world to be extant: And on the other side the aduerse party could bring forth none of former tymes to speake in his fauour, alledging only that all his Forefathers &amp; keepers of the land, were &amp; had been inuisible, vnknown &amp; latent; what Iudge, I pray you, what reasonable Man would make doubt who had the better right in Law? So it is betwixt vs Catholiks &amp; the Protestants: for we produce for our Religion the Iudiciall sentence not only of all the Kings &amp; spirituall Iudges of our Kingdom of Scotland iudicially pronounced, but of the whole world, and that not at one tyme but at seueral, for the space of fifteen hundred years; iudicially I say, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, &amp; all accepted, ratifyed, executed, &amp; by publike monuments testified. The Ministers in the contrary can name no visible predecessors for their Religion, yea bring nothing but their own phancies &amp; inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ōs, vnder the Childish pretext of the word of God; bring no Iudiciall sē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen in their behalfe by either Coūsell, or Parlament, or Publike monument, shew vs no Author, name vs no writter, specifie no marke or token of the being of their Religion before Luther and Caluin: shall then any reasonable Man thinke such Ministers &amp; preachers to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Right or Commission to preach, to haue any ground in the word of God, any warrant for their religion, any antiquity or lineall succession.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore I earnestly intreate the Christian Reader to giue place to reason, &amp; to eschew their new Religion &amp; profession, if he will auoyd his eternall ruine, &amp; losse of euerlasting saluation, which is the due &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable reward allotted for misbelieuers: from the which Christ Iesus free all them who are effectually desirous to liue, &amp; dye in the true and Catholike Church, Amen.

                        <hi>the Masse,</hi> from <hi>Messias,</hi> because we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that the true Messias is offered therin. See S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, S. Basil, S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose, S. Augustin, with many others, who plainly say, that our Sauiour did offer vp, <hi>an vnbloudy Sacrifice for vs, in his last Supper:</hi> and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apostles and their Successours, to offer vp the same dayly. Which Sacrifice S. Ambrose, and other holy and learned ancient Fathers call <hi>the Masse.</hi> I will heer omit to bring other places of the Scripture to proue the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, and the verity of the blessed Sacramēt, reseruing the same to euery Age in particuler, where I will also shew, how manifestly the Ministers haue corrupted their owne Bibles in all debatable points of Religion, but specially in this of the holy <hi>Masse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now I will intreat the Reader to consider with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out passion, how that those expresse and formal words of the Bible aforerehearsed do make for vs Catholiks, and no wyse for the Ministers, who grant willingly that these poynts and articles of their Religion. <hi>This is a figure of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; This fignifieth my Body; we take the Body of Christ by fayth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not really,</hi> are not in playne termes &amp; expresse words to be found in their owne Bible: But they will proue, say they, these articles by necessary consequence out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: As M. <hi>Andrew Ramsey</hi> granted, in disputing at seuerall tymes with me in prison, and before some Lords of the Councel of Scotland; he granted (I say) that he could not proue that there were only two Sacraments out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176665:45"/> words of the Bible, eyther Hebrew, Greek, or Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and such other debatable poynts; but that he could proue it (said he) by necessary consequence: and yet could he neuer make a necessary consequence. To the which say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of M. <hi>Andrew Ramsey,</hi> I replyed then, and now reply thus: 1. <hi>M. Andrew Ramsey</hi> must needes then auow, that he cannot proue, not one debatable poynt of his Religion by the expresse word, the formall text, the pure word of God; or if he can, I challenge him heer before the whole world to do the same, and to set out in print his necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, to the end the world may see them. 2. That M. <hi>Andrew</hi> his consequences cānot be called the Word of God, and consequently cannot be the ground of a poynt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which must needs be <hi>infallible.</hi> 3. Eyther <hi>Maister Ramsey</hi> Minister of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> may erre in making of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, or no? If he grant that he may erre, how then can his consequences be <hi>infallible,</hi> as an article of Fayth must be. If he say he cannot erre in making his consequences: who is so sensles to think, that the true Church of God hath erred, and may erre (as the Ministers belieue) seing <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Andrew Ramsey</hi> (who is but a sinfull man, an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Minister) cannot erre in making his consequences, which are no other thing but his owne inuentions, drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, expositions, and plaine heresies, which the ignorāt people of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> thinke foolishly to be the Word of God. 4. The conclusion of a Syllogisme, as drawne out of the premisses, <hi>sub illa formalitate,</hi> cannot be a poynt of Fayth; for as it is drawen out, <hi>vi formae,</hi> of the premisses, it is grounded vpon Logike, or the Syllogisticall forme of Logik, which is an inuention of man, and consequently it cannot be the ground of true Religiō which must needs be <hi>infallible.</hi> Let <hi>Maister Ramsey</hi> then remark this poynt of Philosophy: <hi>Conclusio vt formaliter deducta nunquam est de fide, id est, vt deducitur vi formae, in modo &amp; figura.</hi> 5. All Heretiks haue vsed the Scripture to confirme their heresies and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies. As <hi>Ariue</hi> out of these wordes,<note n="(l)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Cast thy selfe downe.</hi> 6. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Maister Ramsey</hi> made a Syllogisme, wherof the <hi>maior</hi> &amp; <hi>minor</hi> propositions were playne and expresse words of the Bible, which he shall not be able to do to his aduantage; yet the conclusion or consequēce needeth not to be a point of Religion. The reason of this is, because <hi>Conclusio sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur debiliorem partem,</hi> and the Syllogisticall forme of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is a part, and the weakest in that case, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently erroneous, and not infallible. 7. If the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be in expresse words in the Bible, and the other not, though true, then the conclusion can no wyse be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and a poynt of <hi>Diuine Fayth,</hi> which is <hi>infallible.</hi> The reason is: <hi>Quia conclusio sequitur debiliorem partem.</hi> 8. The ground of al Syllogismes and arguments are. 1. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the same thing be, and be not. 2. Euery thing is, or is not. 3. One verity cannot gaynstand another. 4. <hi>Conclusio sequitur debiliorem partem.</hi> 5. <hi>Ex puris negatiuis nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur,</hi> and such others, which though most true, yet as they are not in expresse words in the Bible, so they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an infallible ground of the true Religion: because they are humane grounds, subiect to errour, instability, and changing. Contrary, the ground of the true Religion, must needs be infallible. Let not then the Ministers make any accompt of their consequences made against the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament, against the holy Sacrifice of the Masse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any other poynt of our Religion, because they are erroneous and fallible; which gaue occasion to our Sauiour to command vs to beware of the necessary consequences of the Ministers:<note n="(o)" place="margin">

                     <p n="5">5. Now as I haue set downe before, the playne and manifest words of the Bible, to confirme the verity of the Blessed Sacrament, and of the holy Sacrifice of the Masse: so I will set downe the consequences drawne out of those foresayd words of the Bible by the holy Fathers of the first Age, and consequently the constant and infallible belief of the Church of God in this first hundreth yeares. And in my opinion there is no man so sensles, so foolish, and soe careles of his owne saluation, who will not prefer and make greater account of the cōsequēces of the holy Church, and of the holy Fathers, then of these our <hi>Ephemerian</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who haue no vnion amongst themselues, who are come in at their owne hand, without authority, without power and commission, whose lyues, behauiour, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as it is presently well knowne throughout all Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, so in no wise can they be compared to our Ancestors, and holy Fore-fathers, whose deep learning, heauenly wisdome, godly conuersation, charitable and vertuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, doth vtterly confound, specially our Scottish Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters ignorance, worldly greedynes, bad conuersation, and most vicious behauiour.

And notwithstanding that the outward actions of kneeling, bowing, kissing, praying &amp;c. be indifferently giuē to God, to the Saints, and ciuill men; yet the intention and mind of him who doth those outward actions distinguisheth the same: for kneeling to God is diuine worship: kneling to Saints is an inferiour pious worship or honour; kneeling to a mortall King is ciuill honour.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. To make this mater more plaine, it is to be remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: that we Catholiks pray not to the Saints in Heauen eyther as Gods to help vs. Redeemers to saue vs, or as the chiefe Authors of any gift or grace bestowed vpon vs. For we acknowledge <hi>only God,</hi> to be the supreme Author and fountaine of all naturall and supernaturall fauours, of grace and glorie. Secondly, we pray not to Saints as <hi>Mediatours of our redemption,</hi> but, <hi>of Intercession only:</hi> for our Mediatour and Aduocat of redemption is only Chryst Iesus, as the Apostle sayth:<note n="(c)" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note>
                        <hi>If any man sinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, Iesus Chryst the Iust; and he is the reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi> And agayne:<note n="(d)" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</note>
                        <hi>There is one God &amp; one Mediator betwixt God and man, which is the man Christ Iesus.</hi> Which place though corrupted by the Ministers, yet speaketh only of <hi>the Mediatour of Redemption:</hi> for the Scripture witnesseth playnly, that Moyses was Mediatour betwixt God and the

                           <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 19.</note>
                        <hi>For the Law was ordeyned by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour.</hi> Wherby the Bible auerreth a <hi>Mediatour of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> besides Christ Iesus. And this is the reason wherfore we Catholikes euer addresse all our petitions to Saintes or Angels with this conclusion: <hi>per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum filium tuum &amp;c.</hi> declaring therby that Chryst is only our Aduocat or Mediator of Redemption, and that the Saints in heauen, are but intercessours besides the holy Trinity for vs; yea when the Minister is desyred to pray for any friend, he is made therby <hi>Mediator of intercession,</hi> though he be a sinfull man, and of little credit with God, yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of none, in respect of the Saints of Heauen, who are in the estate of glorie, and without spot of sinne.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I conclude then, that the Catholike Church sayth to God only, <hi>haue mercy on vs, saue vs, forgiue vs our sinnes &amp;c.</hi> And to the Saints, <hi>Pray for vs.</hi> And if any Catholike say to any Saint <hi>saue me,</hi> his meaning is, that the Saint saue him by his prayers to God: so we call sometymes the Blessed Virgin Marie our hope, life, refuge, because the brought forth our hope, life, and refuge Christ Iesus. Or because by her intercession she may procure our life and saluation: and in this we follow the practise of the Scripture. For S.

                     <p>Secondly, it is lawful to vs to pray to the Angels or Saints in Heauen, according to the example of the holy Patriarch Iacob:<note n="(m)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 48 <hi>v</hi> 16.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Iob was counselled to pray to the Saints:<note n="(p)" place="margin">

                     <p n="5">5. Now I would aske of the Ministery to giue me so playne &amp; expresse words of the Bible that make for thē.

First then we stand not vpon the name, but vpholde the thinge it selfe: that is, We Catholiks constantly belieue that there is a certaine place where some soules of the Faithful after this lyfe are purged &amp; clensed, which place we call <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The Ministers contrary to our beliefe hold these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions as poynts of faith, necessary to be belieued, <hi>There is no purgatory; The prayers for the dead are superfluous,</hi> and such like, which they shall neuer be able to proue by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of their owne corrupted Bible: but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing empty and voyd, to proue them against vs Catholiks by the expresse word, they are forced to giue vs, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of God, their necessary consequences, which in a word are nothing els but manifest heresies, and playne Idolatry, condemned in Arius a manifest heretike, as S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Aug. l. <hi>16.</hi> de haeres. c. <hi>35.</hi> Epiph. Haeres. <hi>75.</hi>
                        </note> and Epiphanius witnesse, and some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants themselues auow. True it is, that we Catholiks haue not the expresse word for euery poynt of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and we do not tye our selues to that alone, but rather
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176665:61"/> to the word of God, together with the consequences and expositions of the holy Church, and Fathers, which hath these sixteene hundreth yeares byn famous amongst all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Ministers contrary, promise to the poore people <hi>only the expresse word of God,</hi> setting a syde the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the holy Church and Fathers: Yet in effect they giue nothing lesse then he expresse word of God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the word of God their owne consequences, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and expositions, not making accompt of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the doctrine, of the holynesse of all our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Can there be any excuse in the day of Iudgment for those men, who willingly &amp; wittingly prefer the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Ministers, before the constant and vniforme exposition of the holy Fathers? For example S. Augustine (who was aboue twelue hundreth yeares since) proueth <hi>Purgatory</hi> out of these words of the Prophet Malachie, who speaking of the last penall Iudgement, sayth thus:<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        <hi>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall endure when he appeareth? for he is lyke a purging fire, and lyke fullers sope. And he shall sit downe to try and fine the siluer: he shall euen fine the sonnes of Leui, and purifie them as gold and siluer.</hi> S. Augustine (I say) hence doth infer Purgatory:<note n="(b)" place="margin">Aug. l. <hi>20.</hi> de ciuit. Dei c. <hi>25.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>For these words</hi> (sayth he) <hi>cannot signifie a separation only of the polluted from the pure in the last penall Iudgement &amp;c. but must intimate a purgation of the good, who haue need therof.</hi> The same S.

                        </gap>e. Our Sauiour was sent by his Father to forgiue all sinnes, not only by preaching of the word, but also as a Iudge pronoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176665:67"/> the sentence of absolution, for so he said to Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene without preaching:<note n="(b)" place="margin">

                        <hi>So when the multitude saw it, they meruailed and glorified God, which had giuen such authority to men.</hi> Now that power which our Sauiour receaued of his Father, he gaue it to his Apostles and to their successours, and that as a great benefite wherof the posterity of man would haue need. Secondly, our Sauiour breathed giuing this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, declaring therby, that by vertue of the holy Ghost which he breathed in them they might forgiue sinnes, so that when the Priest forgiueth sinnes, it is rather the holy Ghost who forgiueth them, then the Priest, who is only but an instrument. <hi>And Iesus said vnto them, receaue the holy Ghost, whose sinnes yee remit &amp;c.</hi> So that by these wordes, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction is giuen to the Preists to forgiue sinnes, as S. Cyrill witnesseth:<note n="(e)" place="margin">Lib. <hi>12.</hi> c. <hi>50.</hi> in Io.</note>
                        <hi>It is neyther absurd, nor yet inconuenient that they forgiue sinnes who haue the holy Ghost, for when they pardon or retayne sinnes, the holy Ghost pardoneth or retayneth sinnes by thē: and that they do two wayes, by Baptisme first, afterward by Pēnance:</hi> He sayth not, that by preaching of the word, sinnes are pardoned.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Lastly this power granted to Priests was not only to declare by the preaching of the word, the absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinnes, but by a true authority giuen by God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sins. So S. Athanasius calleth it,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Serm. in illa verba, profecti in pagum.</note>
                        <hi>A power giuen by our Sauiour to Priests to loose sinnes.</hi> But specially S. Chrysostome declareth this power to be an inward dignity giuen to Priests by God aboue Kings and Princes.<note n="(g)" place="margin">Chrys. l. <hi>3.</hi> de Sacer.</note>
                        <hi>They that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the earth and conuerse theron, to them commission is giuen to dispense those things that are in heauen. To them that power is giuen, which Almighty God would not communicate eyther to Angell or Archangell: For to them it is not said, Whatsoeuer ye shall bind in earth shalbe bound in heauen &amp;c. Earthly Princes indeed haue also authority to bind, but the bodyes only: but that binding of Preists which I treat of toucheth the very soule it selfe, and reacheth euen to the heauens. In so much as whatsoeuer the Preists performe beneath,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:176665:67"/> the very same Almighty God doth aboue: and the sentence of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant our Lord doth confirme. And what is this truely els, but that the power of heauenly things is granted by God vnto them? whose sinnes soeuer</hi> (sayth he) <hi>ye shall retayne, they are retayned. What power I beseech you can be greater then this? The Father gaue all power vnto the Sonne: But I see the same power delyuered altogether by the Sonne vnto them.</hi> Wherfore as our Sauiour Chryst Iesus had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall power to forgiue sinnes, distinct from this power of preaching; so the power he gaue to the Apostles to preach, was distinct from the power giuen to them to forgiue sinnes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This power of <hi>Priests</hi> to forgiue sinnes, being so established, it is easie to declare how confession of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to a Priest, ensueth necessarly of the forsaid power giuē to Preists, and consequently that it is not sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our sinnes to God priuatly, but we must, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, confesse our sinnes to the Priests, since God hath giuen them power to forgiue vs our sinnes. And in effect that which we confes to the Priest is cōfessed to God himselfe, who hath ordeyned the Priest as an instrument of this holy Sacrament. So sayth S.

And as the authority to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach which Christ gaue to the Disciples, were in vayne if
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:176665:68"/> men were not obliged therby in conscience to giue eare to the preached word: so idle, and in vayne were the power that Chryst gaue to his Apostles to retayne or forgiue sins, if all sorts of men (who haue offended after Baptisme) were not tyed &amp; obliged to submit their sinnes vnto the <hi>Priests,</hi> who are the Apostles successours, which submission euery one is obliged to performe for two reasons.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. First, because as Boetius sayth:<note n="(k)" place="margin">De cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solat. pros. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>If thou desire the helpe of the Physitian, it is requisite thou discouer thy desease.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is necessary, that those who are burdened with sores of many sinnes, discouer the same to the spiritual Physitian appoynted for their cure. Secondly, because Priests are made (by the vertue of the commission granted by God to them) not only Physitians, but also <hi>spirituall Iudges,</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the quality of our crymes, to know what medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pennance they should apply, to discerne what sinnes are to be remitted, and what are to be retayned. Now I say, since they are Iudges, they cannot iudge sufficiently of the quality of sinnes, and pronounce as Iudges the sentence of absolution except that our sinnes be discouered vnto them, conforme to that commō saying. It is impossible for a man to iudge discreetly who hath no knowledge of the case. And naturall reason proueth the same manifestly, and the custome of all ciuill countries wherin Iudges are cōstituted sheweth, that before a Iudge pronounce any sentence in Iudgement, he must needs haue notice and knowledge of the cause which he iudgeth. Now there is but two meanes wherby we may giue notice of our sinnes to the Priest, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publickly or priuatly.

Secondly he witnesseth that in the primitiue Church the custome was to declare in particular the number of our sinnes in confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so far as man can remember, for God doth not oblige vs to impossible things. And euen as a souldiour hauing receaued many wounds in warre, it is not sufficient to tell his Physitian in generall only, that he is wounded, but he must shew the seuerall wounds, otherwyse no man will venter to heale and cure him: euen so, it is not sufficient for a Christian wounded in his soule with diuers deadly sins, to complayne and confesse in generall, but he must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly specify (so far as he can remember) the number and quality of deadly sinnes, that therby the spirituall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian (that is the Priest) may discerne what satisfactory Penance, what good counsell and aduyse he should giue vnto the penitent: which doctrine is of S. Gregory, who sayth:<note n="(b)" place="margin">Greg. Niss. Ep. ad Episcop. Mytil.</note>

                           <hi>Then the Bishop or Priest knoweth who is to be bound, and who is to be loosed, when he heareth the variety of sinnes.</hi> And the reason is euident.

When I was in prison for the Catholike Religiō in Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh straitly warded and narrowly kept, I offered at seuerall tymes to some Ministers, that for as much as the Bible is diuersly exponed of vs and of them, they neyther being tyed to my interpretation, nor I to theirs; I desired them earnestly to put aside my interpretation, and their owne likewise, referring the mater to the interpretations and Iudgement of the ancient Fathers, of generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, of vniuersall custome, of tymes and places amongst all Nations. M. Andrew Ramsey answered no, we will not referre the mater to the ancient Fathers, rather we will referre it to Caluin, Beza, and such. Wherunto I was content, so he should bring me Caluin and Beza to try thē with the touchstone of the Bible, which he would not performe. Other Ministers at other tymes answered, we will be tryed by the Scriptures only, by the word of God, by the Bible. I replyed, will ye be tryed by the expresse
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176665:77"/> word of God only, or by the word of God interpreted as it pleaseth you? Some of them answered, we haue the spirit of God to interpret the Scripture. I replyed: Thē yee will be both party and Iudges; had not the holy Fathers the spirit of God? had no Nation, no kingdome, no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the spirit of God before the comming of Luther and Caluin? Hath not that bene the brag of all heretiks.

I replyed, that one corrupted place of the Hebrew Bible is sufficient to take away all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority of the word of God from it, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to be the word of God: euen as in a contract band or obligation, if there be but one essentiall fault or falsity, the rest of the contract or band is reiected, and hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, much more in the word of God, wherin all is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall &amp; necessary to be belieued vnder the paine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. For we cannot iudge of the Bible and word of God as of other books, as Virgil, Ouid, William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and Dauid Lindesay, wherin though there may be some errours, corruptions, and lies, yet there be some tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes and verities, which neuertheles cannot be called infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible verities, but rather fallible. Contrary, the Bible and word of God being ēdyted to the holy wryters as to Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the holy Prophets, Euangelists, and Apostles, by God himselfe, must haue wholly infallible verities, because they were infallibly assisted with the holy Spirit, &amp; that in such sort, that they could not erre in wryting those holy Books: and if we grant that they haue erred but once, yea ōly once, it followeth necessarly that they had not a infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible assistance of the holy Ghost &amp; consequently the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of such a Bible shall euer be incertayne when they had infallible assistance of God, &amp; when not: which is the reasō
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176665:78"/> also wherfore the Scottish &amp; English Bible translated by the Ministers cannot be the infallible word of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ministers had not in translating the Bible an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assistance of God, but as men, and ignorant men might erre, and erred filthily almost in euery verse.</p>

To these discourses of myne, one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters answered, that it was not a poynt of faith, that the Scottish or English Bible is the infallible word of God, which sundry Ministers of Frāce, speaking of their French Bible, haue affirmed publickly.

That the best liuing Protestant or Puritane that is, is euer in the state of the curse and malediction of God: because, say the Ministers, no man can perfitly fulfill the Commands: wheron followeth this Syllogisme. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are obliged vnder the payne of condemnation to eschew sinne. But the holyest worke which they can do in this world, as to take the supper of the Lord, to pray, to preach, to giue almes, to sing the psalmes, are alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned necessarly with deadly sinne. Ergo the Ministers are obliged vnder the payne of condemnation, not to do any of those works. The Maior is euident:<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Ergo &amp;c. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs Catholiks &amp; the Protestants in this poynt is, that we teach that we may keep the Commandements of God, (being assisted by his grace) according to the rigour of the Law, hauing regard to our weaknes &amp; fragility, yet we cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that sundry tymes we trangresse the Cōmandments, and hauing transgressed them we may ryse from the state of sinne to the state of grace, assisted by the help of God; and thus being assisted by the grace of God, we may do some good works voyde and empty of any deadly sinne. The Protestants do beleue the contrary, that we cannot keep the Cōmandmēts, though assisted by the grace of God, that cōtinually we transgresse the Cōmandments, that the best worke that a man can do hath sinne necessarly ioyned with it; which doctrines they hold against the expresse word of God, and against all Scripture.

The reason wherof is, because a morall act or action can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> be good and bad, pure and defiled: for as it inuolueth contradiction, that one and the same assent of our vnderstanding can be at the same tyme both true and false: so it is impossible that one and the same act of our will, should be ioyntly at the same moment good and euil, pleasing and displeasing to God. Wherfore if the best actiō we can do, hath drosse &amp; spots of sin ioyned with it, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of necessity that all our actions are sins, yea deadly sinnes. True it is, that in materiall substance really distinct, the one substance may be good, and the other bad; the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176665:84"/> badnes of the one not hindering the goodnes of the other, as drosse may be mingled with good siluer: But so it is not in morall actiōs, which eyther are fully good or fully bad.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Concerning the second poynt that our good workes are meritorious, it is to be remarked, that three thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are necessary to make our actions and good workes meritorious, all which three do flow from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e merits of Christ and the holy streames of his bloud shed for vs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which no worke of man can haue any merit. The first thing requisite is, that no worke of man can truely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or deserue reward, except being wrought with the help of God, it also prooceed from the inherent grace of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in our soules, wherby our actions are enobled greately in the sight of God. The second thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued is, that God hath ioyned the seale of his promise &amp; obliged himselfe by his owne word to remunerate our works: for though God be not obliged to ingage himselfe to vs his poore creatures, yet hauing promised and ingaged himselfe to recompense our labours and good workes (to the end he may animate, and stir vs vp therby to do good works) he is obliged to performe his promise: Euen as a king not being obliged to giue some extraordinary aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement to some poore subiect of his own, yet hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the same, and sealed his promise solemnely, he is obliged to performe the same: so standeth the case betwixt God and vs. The third is, that all meritorious actions be freely and sincerely done; freely from the necessity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, sincerely from the badnes of sinister intentions. These things presupposed we Catholiks constantly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that good workes are worthy of reward and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of euerlasting life: not that there is an arithmetical equality or proportion betwixt our good works and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly felicity, as is betwixt one shilling and another, one crown of Gold and another: for what proportion can be betwixt a finite and infinite thing? But the proportion only is that, which is betwixt grace and glory, as betwixt the seed sowen in the ground, &amp; the statelynes of the tree which cometh of the seed, which is a <hi>vertuall proportion.</hi> For
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:176665:84"/> the which cause the word of God expreslly teacheth vs that our good workes are worthy of God. And specially spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the constancy of Catholiks, who do remayne in the midst of heretiks,<note n="(q)" place="margin">

                     <p n="7">7.

                        <hi>That they receaue remission of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by fayth only</hi>) must needs be a good worke, or a bad worke: If a good work (cōfrome to that of our Sauiour,<note n="(d)" place="margin">

                        <hi>This is the worke of God that yee belieue in him whome he hath sent.</hi>) it must needs haue some spot of sinne ioyned with it, and consequently the Protestant is instified by sinne and sinfull
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:176665:85"/> actions. Likewise when the Protestant prayeth thus: <hi>And forgiue vs our sinnes:</hi> eyther this prayer is fully a good worke or els spotted with sinne and iniquity. It spotted with sin, then the Protestants do obteyne remission of their sins, by sins thēselus, &amp; a sinfull petition which is greatly absurd.</p>
                     <p n="8">8.

Now I would intreat the vnpassionate Reader to remarke diligently how that this poynt of doctrine of good workes with many others which the Catholiks do teach, tendeth fully to the increase of piety, and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, to good life and conuersation. Contrary, the Protestants doctrine against good works and merits, against the keeping of the Commandemēts &amp;c. disposeth a man to all sort of wickednes: for the Protestants Gospell and doctrine denyeth a man to haue free will, to do good, to absteyne from sinne; teacheth the Commandements of God to be impossible to be kept, yea with the grace of God:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:176665:88"/> And who will euer assay to do, which he hath not power to will, or possibility to performe? And who can with any courage endeauour to keep that which he knoweth before hand to be impossible to be kept? Likewyse the Ministers hold, that God doth purpose, decree and cooperate to the obstinacy of the wicked, and that whatsoeuer he wil, must of necessity ensue. That God doth creat some and ordeyne them (not hauing any regard to their bad behauiour) to the eternall fyre of hell. Which blasphemy is fully against the tender bowells of his infinite mercy.<note place="margin">VVitaker cont. <hi>1.</hi> quast. <hi>5.</hi>
                           </note> The Protestants auowe all our good works, euen the best, to be stayned with sinne, and displeasing to God, and therfore do merit damnation: A blasphemy repugnant to the very light of nature, reason, and word of God. In like manner many of the Protestants directly do teach, that a man once iustified cannot loose his iustice whatsoeuer wickednes he doth cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. That God doth not impute to the faithfull the vncle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes of their dishonest lyues: Could any Mahometan desire more pleasing dreames to flesh and blood? The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters allow no distinction of veniall and mortall sinnes, yea euen the sodayne and inuoluntary motions of the flesh they affirme to be of their owne nature damnable and deadly, yet if they haue faith (that is a forged persuasion of their owne) there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, say they. Doth not this doctrine plane the way to all wickednes, to all iniquity, and mischiefe? for that the Protestant who persuadeth himselfe, that no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Pryde, Pleasure, no wrong done to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, can be hurtfull vnto him and procure damnation if he belieue and haue faith: The Protestant I say, who doth belieue the first motions or euill suggestions to be deadly and mortall sinnes, as well as the consent or consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; what stop or barre can such a man haue to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For he may reason thus with himself: since I am already drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all sort of sinnes, since I continually transgresse the Commandements, since my first motions are deadly sins though I consent not to them, since the best worke I can

                     <p n="2">2. The Catholike Church teacheth that neyther in the old or new Law, any man was, or is bound to vow eyther chastity, pouerty, or such: but that it is, and euer was a Counsell &amp; not a Commandement: yet a thing of great deuotion and perfection in the old &amp; new Law, intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally belonging &amp; furthering to the true worship of God; which I proue. In a vow there be two things to be cōside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the one is, the good which is vowed, called the materiall part, for example, fasting, praying; the other, the promise it selfe made to God, which is the formall part: the material parts do belōg vnto their seuerall vertues, but the promise and fulfilling of the vow is a substantiall part of the worship of God: the reason is, because by promising and vowing any good thing to God, we acknowledge and professe therby that God is the soueraigne goodnes it selfe, supreme verity and worthy of al sort of holy seruice: in performing also that which we haue vowed, we testify that God is full of Maiesty, Reuerend, and Dreadfull; and consequently, that all promises and vowes made to God righteously are to be accomplished diligently, &amp; without delay, because by those vowes we honour and worship him. By the contrary, they much dishonour God, who breake with him and keep not their vowes. If then all other vertuous seruice done to the glory of God be parts of his true worship, much more vowes are to be thought parts of the true worship of God: wherof it followes necessarily that at all tymes vowes were, and may be vsed; and that they were in practise before the Law of Moyses, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that vow which Iacob made of setting vp a stone, and of paying the tenthes of all his goods:<note n="(f)" place="margin">

True it is, that I haue conferred with some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Scotland, who were certaynly perswaded (as they said) <hi>that the true Church of God could not erre.</hi> That the true Church of God is infallible in proponing matters of faith to be belieued: Others denying the same but ignorantly, of passion rather, then of reason conforme to their custome. But to the end this matter be deduced more playnly I will intreat the Reader to consider.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. First, that the word <hi>Church,</hi> may be taken foure seuerall wayes. First, for the whole company of Christian professours consisting of sheep and Pastors, that is, of some
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176665:107"/> who by Gods ordinance and appoyntement, haue office and authority to feed, and teach the right faith and religion; and of others who are taught: and thus the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken when we say, <hi>the Church of God is vniuersal and Catholike: The Church of God hath euer bene and shalbe.</hi> Secondly, the word Church is taken for the more principall part of that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to wit, the full company of Pastors gathered togeather or dispersed throughout the world. Thirdly for a principal member, to wit, the visible head of this mysticall body, the chief Pastor, Christs vicar, S. Peters successour called the Pope: Not as he is a particular and priuate man, but as ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, or at least assisted with a generall Councel, hath receaued of Christ ful authority to feed the Christian flock, by proponing to them maters of faith. Fourthly, the Church is taken for euery particular Pastour, not as he is a priuate man, but as he is authorized, vnder, and with dependance of the chief pastor to feed that flock p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Iohn Knox, Willox, Craig, and such like (nothing els but our dregs, yet the first and chief pillars of the deformed Scots religion) who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched first the Puritans religion, had no ordinary calling to do the same, because they were not authorized by their immediat superiors, nor yet by the chief Pastor, to preach such a new religion. As for extraordinary calling and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they had none (though ignorantly they brag of it) by reason as they were not sent extraordinarly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by God, so they had no marks of extraordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which are humility, extraordinary good and holy Life and Miracles, as witnesseth the Scripture in Moyses, the Prophets, S.

Secondly, consider that the infallible and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authority that I am to proue to be in the Church of God, is with reason called the authority of the Church, specially as the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken in the third significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being ordayned to the proffit of the whole Church, and of euery mēber therof, in regard of the doctrine which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176665:107"/> proceedeth, and taketh hold from the authority of the Church: which doctrine as it is in it selfe infallible, so it worketh infallibility in the hart of euery seuerall person, so much, as he groundeth his faith vpon the diuine doctrine reuealed by God to the Church, and proponed to him by the Church. So that God the prime Verity of all doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale (conforme to his promise set down in seuerall places of the Bible) to the Church that holy doctrine which we should belieue vnder payne of damnation: for,<note n="(b)" place="margin">

Likewyse how ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:176665:108"/> the Ministers do teach, that we beleue whatsoeuer the Church proponeth, as a mater of faith, though it be against the Scripture: for it is impossible that the true Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infallibly assisted by God (according to his promise) can, or may propone any thing which is against, or besids the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fourthly, of the said doctrine it followeth likewayes how ignorantly the Ministers do preach, that we beleue as maters of fayth, all visions and miracles of Saintes &amp;c. Which is a manifest calumny. For as it were temerity, rashnes, &amp; a sort of folly to deny or misbelieue <hi>(fide humana &amp; piè,)</hi> those miracles, which so many wyse, holy and learned Pastours, Kings and Princes, Kingdomes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue constantly auowed; So we belieue only those which the Catholike Church <hi>(authoritatiuè)</hi> proponeth to be belieued as maters of faith, which are very few.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Fyftly, when I say, the authority of the Church is absolute and infallible. I do not vnderstand, as if it were independant of God or his word, as though the Church might at pleasure pronoūce any doctrine to be <hi>diuine,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to God or his word. But I accompt the doctrine of the Church to be infallible of it selfe, and the authority to be absolute in respect of vs, in this sense, that we, after the sentence of this or that poynt of faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Church, we (I say) are absolutly bound and obliged to submit our iudgements, and to belieue that for infallible truth, which by the Church is defyned for such.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:176665:109"/> be <hi>diuine</hi> but <hi>humane:</hi> for diuine faith, as it is infallible, so the last resolution therof must be in some infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which cānot be, except in the authority of the church: which verity gaue occasion to S.

                     <p n="8">8. As concerning the infallibility of the Church, which I promised to proue; it is to be remarked, that I take the word <hi>Church,</hi> as a company of men assisted infallibly by the holy Ghost, the doctrine wherof consequently is called, not meerly <hi>humane,</hi> but rather <hi>diuine:</hi> as proceeding originally and principally from the spirit of God. This being noted, I proue the infallible authority of the church in maters of faith, out of these places of the Bible. First:<note n="(i)" place="margin">

Ergo, the first proposition is certayne, and as it were, in playne words in the Bible. The Minor I proue: Because Christ sent his Apostles, and their successors with that authority, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his heauenly Father sent him: But that authority was infallible. Ergo the authority of the Apostles and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours must needs be infallible.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Secondly if the authority of the Church, in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning maters of faith to be belieued, were fallible, or could in such a case erre or deceaue vs, it would follow, that God himselfe could be the author of false belief, by teaching &amp; causing the church to teach false doctrine in maters of faith: but that is impious and abhominable to grant, that God the prime verity can possibly be the author of false belief, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Church, or permitting the same to teach false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. That it would follow, God to be the authour of false belief, I prooue it in this sort. What authority the Church hath to propone maters of diuine faith, is grounded wholly in the authority of God, promising infallible assistance to the Church, sending and appoynting the Pastours therof to preach and teach, commanding vs to heare and obey thē, threatning those who will not obey, as the places of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before specified do witnesse. Ergo if the authority of the Church be fallible and may deceaue men, inducing them to belieue that which is false; God himself ordeyning this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority should be iustly esteemed author of this false belief, &amp; men might iustly &amp; with reason say to God in the later day (as learnedly Richardus à Sancto Victore a Scotsman remarketh):<note n="(n)" place="margin">Lib. <hi>18.</hi> de Trinit. cap: <hi>2.</hi>

If you say that there is some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural quality in the bread, &amp; wine, wherūto you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate your selues, I aske: either you giue diuine, ciuil, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship to the bread considered with this quality or not? If <hi>Diuine,</hi> conforme to the wordes of the Parlamēt, it is manifest Idolatry, for this quality though supernaturall, is a creature, and not God? If Ciuill, then you giue Ciuill, worldly, and transitory honour, to a supernaturall thing, which is absurd, and a manifest sacriledge.

Conforme to which natural light the Catholiks, out of the great loue they carry to God, they loue those who haue bene Gods speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all friends, as the blessed Virgin Mary, the holy Apostles, the holy Martyrs, and such: who as they haue bene speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and constant friends of God in this world, and do ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne now with him in heauē; so we should loue them spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and loue those things which doe appertayne vnto them. Wherof I inferre, that the Protestants in denying the honour due to the Saints in heauen, deny in lyke manner the honour due to God himselfe, as is manifest by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

For would you not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect such loue towards his Maiesty to be nothing else, but playne hypocrisy and disloyalty? So do the Protestants in Scotland: they professe all honour and affection, say they, to Christ, but they reuile his mother, and will haue no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour giuē vnto her; they beare no respect to Christs fauorits the Apostles, and Martyrs; which is all agaynst the law of friendship, and agaynst the common Prouerbe, <hi>loue me, and loue my friends.</hi>

                           <hi>Therefore I say vnto the vnmarryed, and vnto the widdowes, it is good for them if they abide euen as I doe.</hi> How could he then counsell or cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Bishops to do that which they could not remarke in himselfe. 3. S. Paul commēdeth the office of a Bishop as a most noble, holy, and sublime office, yet hard and difficile; and in effect<note n="(c)" place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>148.</hi>
                           </note>
                           <hi>There is nothing in this life, and specially at this tyme, harder, more laborious, or more dangerous then the office of a Bishop, Priest, or Deacon: But before God nothing more blessed, if they be in such sort as our captayne commandeth.</hi> How then could S. Paul, yea thinke only, that it were expedient to a Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op or Priest to marry? since marriage alone bereaueth a mā wholly of al his wits, by reason of the great burthen, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable cares of marriage, as witnesseth S.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:176665:156"/> Virgins or vnmarryed persons, as S. Augustin wysely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked saying: <hi>Minùs virgo quàm vidua, minùs vidua quàm nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> 4. S. Paul sayth:<note n="(e)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 34.</note>

The reason wherfore Freewill must needs be graūted to man, is grounded in the inward nature of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice, by reason that no action can be morally good or morally bad, except it be voluntary, conforme to that famous saying of S. Augustine. <hi>Sinne is so voluntary, that except it were voluntary, it were not sinne.</hi> Where the word <hi>voluntary,</hi> is taken for that which is freely done, and which was in the liberty of man to do or not to do, directly contrary to that which is done of necessity. So S. Augustine in another place:<note n="(s)" place="margin">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176665:164"/> to be belieued vnder the payne of eternall dānation) that his sins are forgiuen him, inferring consequently that this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fayth doth iustify him. And in this solifidian, foolish, &amp; childish persuasion the Protestants do place their <hi>iustifying Fayth,</hi> agaynst the which I make this argument. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant who by this <hi>Fayth</hi> is iustified, may after fall into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and other damnable sinnes, or not? That he can not fall, no man will say, by reason that they continually transgresse the commandements: if he may fall, I aske, whether falling into those horrible sins he loose that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Fayth or retayne it stil? To graunt that he looseth it, is to make all sinners Atheists and Infidels, for he who is bereft of Fayth must needes be infected with atheisme and infidelity: if he still retayne his true Fayth, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the infinite multitude of such sinnes, is to hold, that he abydeth still in the estate of saluation, and may enioy the kingdom of heauen dying in such a miserable estate, which is directly agaynst the Bible.<note n="(a)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note>

I answere, that to be false, because he speaketh of the Faith wherby we belieue in God which is inward Fayth. 2. He speaketh of Abrahams Fayth, which was a true and inward iustifying Fayth.

Some Fathers do say sometymes, that man is not iustifyed by workes absolutely, meaning the workes of nature, of morall vertues without the grace &amp; knowledge of Christ, or els workes done in the state of sinne before iustification, but neuer say the Fathers, that workes proceeding from a liuely fayth, and done in the grace of God, do not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third argument, when a Protestant persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himselfe or belieueth infallibly his sinnes to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, by this his particular and iustifying Faith; eyther he hath his sinnes by that Fayth remitted to him before, or after he thus belieues: if after, then his persuasion is false &amp; deceitfull, belieuing the remission of his sinnes which was not when he made that act of Fayth: if before that act of Fayth his sinnes were remitted, it followeth that iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was before his beliefe, which cannot be, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fayth it is impossible to please God. If the Minister say, that his beliefe causeth immediatly the remission of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which he belieueth, it is lykewise false; for after that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:176665:165"/> forme, the Ministers beliefe were omnipotent, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the obiect which it knoweth, the mystery it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth. As if a man by belieuing himselfe to be a great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in Phisik, should consequently be a perfect Doctor by reason of his beliefe, directly agaynst that famous saying of S.

                        </gap>ct which we know is true or false; so our beliefe is certayne &amp; true, because the thing is infallible which we belieue. As by example, God is omnipotent, not because I belieue him to be omnipotēt, but because he is omnipotent in himself, I belieue him to be so, the obiect of Faith alwaies being before the act of Faith, as the obiect of science is alwaies before the habite of sciēce. Plaine contrary to this, the Ministers in belieuing infallibly, &amp; as a point of Fayth their sins to be forgiuen them, do make the obiect of their Faith in belieuing, which is a manifest absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. 2. The Ministers in belieuing infallibly their sinnes to be forgiuen thē, do keep in that the command of God, or breake the command of God. If the first, eyther they keep it perfectly (in that act of Fayth) or imperfectly, &amp; with ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish? If perfectly, it followeth that a man may sometymes and in some things perfectly keep the commaunds, which they will not graūt. If imperfectly, that imperfection being a deadly sin (for al are deadly sinnes in the Ministers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) it followeth of necessity that the Protestants are iustified by a deadly sinne, which is a palpable absurdity.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. I being in prison, a certayne Minister affirmed, that true Fayth wherby we are iustifyed is that which alwayes hath charity and good works ioyned therto. I replied thus, how is charity inseparable from true Fayth? Or is it separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the fruit of the tree is separable from the tree, which remayneth a true &amp; perfect tree without the fruit, or is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity an accidentall quality, or inseparable passion which floweth from Fayth, as the power of laughing from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man? If so, it would follow, that charity could not be in heauen without Fayth which is false. Or is charity an essential forme which is required to the integrity of this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Fayth? If so, then Fayth alone doth not iustify, which is directly agaynst your confession of Faith. If Faith together with charity iustify, as that Fayth is imperfect and mingled with deadly sinne, so is that charity; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it followeth that we are iustifyed by Fayth and charity which conteyne in themselues deadly sinnes.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Of this forsayd discourse I inferre, that our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cōsisteth in the habit of charity, that is, in Faith &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

                        <hi>If it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth God to withdraw of the money which they had vowed to God, how is he angry, when chastity is vowed, and is not performed? For to such may be sayd that which S. Peter sayd of the money: Thy virginity remayning, did it no remayne vnto thee? and before thou didst vow, was it not in thy own power?

                     <p n="3">3. Out of the foresayd discourse I inferre, that we Catholikes haue the playne words of the Bible for making of vowes of chastity, pouerty and obedience. 1. <hi>Vow yee &amp; render your vowes vnto God.</hi> 2. <hi>Whosoeuer voweth a vow vnto the Lord &amp;c. He shall not breake his promise, but shall do according to all which proceedeth from his mouth.</hi> 3. <hi>When thou shalt vow a vow vnto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not be slacke to pay it, for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee.</hi> 4. <hi>When thou hast vowed a vow vnto God deferre not to pay it &amp;c. It is better that thou shouldest not vow, then that thou shouldest vow, and not pay it.</hi> Now I aske of the Ministers to giue as playne and manifest words agaynst the making of vowes. For we Catholikes will euer prefer the expresse word of God and the consequences of the holy Fathers drawne out of the same, to the Ministers manifest heresies.

In like mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the same as to the Oracle of truth, the Christiās were wont to direct the summe of their beliefe, their bookes and writings; yea famous Councells, their Canons and decrees. So Iustinian the Emperour sent the profession of his Fayth to Agapetus the Pope:<note n="(m)" place="margin">Cont. <hi>2.</hi> epist. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. To be short, the Popes of Rome haue alwayes had their legats, as presidents in all Oecumenicall Councells, as Hosius in the first Councell of Nice, S. Cyryll in the Councell of Ephesus. The same I may say of sundry others. In lyke manner the Bishops of France, of Spaine, of Grece, of Germany, of Scotland, England and Ireland receaued their Archiepiscopall Palls from the Popes of Rome. Kings and Emperours haue receaued sundry fauours and titles of honour, as the honorable style of <hi>most Christian</hi> in France, <hi>Catholyke</hi> in Spayne, <hi>Protector of the Fayth</hi> in the Kings of Scotland, <hi>Defender of the Fayth</hi> in the Kings of England. Moreouer the Popes of Rome did prescribe the fashion of crowning of sūdry Kings, which is to this day obserued: for example the King of France is consecrated and annointed by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> acccording to the ordinance of <hi>Hormisda</hi> Pope. The King of England by the Arch-bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of Canterbury, by the ordinance of Pope Hadrian the third. The King of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Arch-bisshop of <hi>S.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176665:182"/> by the Arch-bishop of Mentz. The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Praga,</hi> which sheweth manifestly the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, in spirituall maters, of the Roman Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But the Protestants do say that some Kings and Princes hath resisted and deposed the Pope. I answere, that inferiours may resist and persecute their superiours in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters, but wrongfully. True it is, that Emperours might call sometymes generall Councells, as Aduocats and helpers of the Church, by reason of their temporall power and authority, not as hauing spirituall authority to do the same. True it is lykewise that Gregory the great writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iohn the proud Patriarch of Constantinople (who presumptuously called himself Vniuersall Bishop) sayth, that the name of Vniuersall Bishop is a prophane, proud and sacrilegious title: &amp; so it is indeed, as that Patriarch v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped it, to wit, to be such an absolute and vniuersall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch and Bishop, as to derogate from all others their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall dignity, desirous that no other should be called Bishop, but he himselfe, which was in effect a prophane nouelty; but the Pope vseth not thus the name of Vniuersal. Moreouer it is reason that the Pope of Rome should rather inherite (as S. Peters successour) that prerogatiue, then the Bishop of Antioch where Peter first did sit, or the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of Ierusalem where our Sauiour dyed, wherof S.

Yea notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing three &amp; thirty Popes, who haue bene put to the sword one after another; notwithstāding I say their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for a tyme to Viterbo, Auinion, Rauena; yet the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes haue still returned and placed their seat at Rome. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patriarchall seates haue bene rent in peeces; but the seat of Rome, no death, no banishment, no Tyranny of men, nor malice of Satan could euer ouercome. No the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion amongst themselues, the manifold difficultyes &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their elections, not the great vices which haue bene noted in some of their persons. Which is an euident demō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Gods prouidence in preseruing the Apostolike seat of his Vicar Generall in that holy place, &amp; not at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, nor at Ierusalem, where the succession of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les hath bene interrupted by Schisme, infected by heresies, and ouerthrowen by Turkes and Infidels.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. To conclude, it is a most certayne Tradition that the Pope succeedeth to Peter, and that Peter translated his chayre to the citty of Rome, and there continued Bishop the space of twenty fiue yeares, there ended his lyfe with a glorious martyrdom: and whosoeuer denyeth this, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayth all histories, chronicles, and records of holy Fathers, giuing way to deny in lyke manner effrontedly the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Kings of Spayne, of England, France, Scotland, which we know only by historyes.

Therfore and inuisible Church cannot be the true Church of Christ.</hi> The Minister was incertayne what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this argument; so remayning amazed, another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster answered, and denyed the <hi>Minor,</hi> which I proued in this manner. God cannot commād vs to do a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, for that is against the very naturall wit of man, who will not command to his seruants impossible things. But it is impossible to heare, &amp; so impossible to obey an inuisible Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The other Minister knew not what to answer to this argument, but went out of the prison in passion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising neuertheles to come back agayne, which he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not. But his fellow Protestants being ashamed of this their ouerthrow, did bring in a few dayes after another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:176665:192"/> agaynst whome I made this argument. The true Church of Christ hath alwayes perseuered: But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Church hath not alwayes perseuered; Therefore it is not the true Church of Christ. He denyed the <hi>Minor</hi> which I proued after this forme. If your Church was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in any age from the Apostles dayes to the comming of Luther, Caluin, and Knox, the space of a thousand fiue hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and fifty yeares, eyther it was visible or inuisible. But neyther can be sayd: Therfore it was not extant at all. The Minister answered, that their Church is, and had bene visible, as witnesseth (sayth he) M. Foxes Cronicle. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I replyed thus No manifest and knowne heretikes cā constitute the Church of Christ: but all your false Martyrs and pseudo confessors whome Fox nameth, were knowne heretikes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not constitute the Church of Christ.

                     <p n="2">2. The Reasons (besides the former) which perswade that the Church is infallible, are these following most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. For what could moue any Infidel, Pagan, or Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane to forsake his errours, and come to the true Church, if she might also beguyle him with errour and fallibility? What meanes could the true Church haue to condemne an heretike if she could erre in disprouing his errours? How should we know where to rest, whom to consult in doubte of Fayth, if the true Church the highest Iudge might iudge amisse. What assurance can the Protestants haue of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, Religion, Scripture, Sacraments, Preaching, yea of Christ himselfe, if the Church, which teacheth these particles to them, may erre in teaching? The tradition or testimony of the Romane Church, of whome the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:176665:193"/> haue receaued the Scriptures, of what accōpt can they make it, if it be fallible and subiect to errour? The Fayth which they gather out of the Scriptures, the Religiō which they ground vpon such Scriptures must lykewise be fallible &amp; vncertaine. For the truth gleaned frō the Scriptures cānot be more sure, then the Scriptures themselues from which it is gathered. If they then be fallible, the Scriptures must needes be fallible (in the Protestāts opinion) by reason that the true Church, who hath deliuered the Scriptures to vs, is infallible, say they. And wheras neither Religiō nor Church can without supernatural Fayth, nor supernatural Faith be attained without infallible certainty of the things belieued; if then the Protestant Preachers &amp; Ministers be fallible, the articles they belieue haue not that infallibility which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the nature of Fayth; <hi>Which hath nothing</hi> (sayth S. Bernard) <hi>ambiguous our doubtful, yea, if it hath any thing ambiguous it cannot be Fayth.</hi> Which is the reason wherfore S. Paul wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth that God placed in his Church:<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11.12.</note>
                        <hi>Some Apostles, some Prophets, and other some Euangelists, and other some Pastors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours &amp;c.</hi> Behold heere foure things. 1. Whome he appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists, Pastors, Doctours.</hi> 2. To what function did he imploy them: <hi>To the consummation of Sainctes, to the worke of the Ministery, to the edifying of the body of Christ.</hi> 3. How long was it to continue: <hi>Vntill we meete all into the vnity of Fayth and knowledge of the sonne of God.</hi> 4. To what end was this: <hi>That now we be not children wauering and caryed about with euery wind of doctrine, in the wickednes of men, in craftinesse to the circumuention of errour.</hi> If this be the end and drift of God, specifyed in the Protestants owne Bible, is not God fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate of his intent? Pastours spoyled of their assurāce? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours incertayne of their doctrine, if the true Church may erre and be fallible? I ioyne to this that infallible warrant of Christ speaking of the true Church:<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>
                        <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi> But it were not all one to heare Christ, &amp; to heare his Church, to despise Christ, &amp; to despise his Church, vnlesse the Church and the Pastours thereof were infallibly inspired by God to deliuer all things with such certaynty and infallibility, as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:176665:193"/> is requisite. Lykewise seeing Christ comandeth vs to heare the Church and our true Pastours as himselfe, he who saith that the Church may erre, must needes lykewyse inferre that Christ himself may erre, which is a horible blasphemy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreouer the Prophet I say speaketh in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of God to the Church, thus:<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Isa</hi> 59. <hi>v.</hi> 211.</note>
                        <hi>My spirit that is in thee, and my wordes that I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy seed, and out of the mouth of thy seedes seed, sayth our Lord, from this present and for euer.</hi> What spirit was there in this Prophet, but the spirit of God? What words in his mouth, but the words of truth? Therfore the spirit of God and wordes of truth shall neuer depart from the Church of God, or the true Pastors therof. Can any thing be written more effectually? can any thing be spokē more pithily? Conforme to the which doctrine Christ cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to follow the doctrine of the Church, as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doctrine, &amp; that vnder the payne of condemnation &amp; excommunication:<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17.</note>
                        <hi>If he will not heare the Church</hi> (sayth Christ) <hi>let him be to thee as the heathen and Publican.</hi> How could God threaten vs vnder the curse of damnation to heare and obey his Church, if she could erre, and be infallible? To say, that the Church cannot erre so long as she followeth the word of God, is folly: for if the Church may depart from the word of God she cannot but erre: since then she cannot depart from the word of God, she cannot erre. 2. What pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilege I pray you, can that be aboue any hereticall assēbly? for no heretike, Infidell, Iew, or Turke, yea not the Diuel himselfe can erre as long as he speaketh conforme to Gods word. A certayne Minister replyed to this saying of myne, distinguishing two kinds of errour, one curable, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incurable; one to probation and another to damnatiō confessing lykewyse that the Church might fall into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable errours, but not into incurable. Is this distinction in the expresse word of the Bible? where? in what place? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which foolish distinction I frame this argument: Whosoeuer heareth the Church, followeth the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no error curable or incurable can we incurre by hearing the Church. I proue the <hi>Minor</hi> thus:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176665:194"/> No offence against God can we incurre in following his commandements: but euery error curable or incurable (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in maters of fayth) is an offence against God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no errour curable or incurable, can we incurre by following Gods commandements. I would aske of the Ministers what be those errourrs; be they fundamentall and such as cannot stand with the integrity of faith; or be they sleight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things which do not harme the integrity of faith? If they be sleight and indifferent, we need not to be cured of them, we may without losse of Gods fauour remayne and die in them. The new Gospell then of the Protestants was needles, their reformation, in indifferent errours, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, their breach detestable in making so great a schisme for slēder matter not necessary to saluatiō. Why do they persecute vs &amp; trouble vs for so sleight maters? Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental and incurable they cannot be, vnlesse yee graunt that the Church is fallible, and may erre in fundamentall poynts, which I haue refuted before, and which is directly against the doctrine of the holy Fathers.

As he is iustly the cause of a mans death, who willingly and wittingly delyuereth him into his enemyes hands, by whom he is killed; So the Ministers do make God to be author of al the sinnes &amp; abhominations of the wicked, their words be:<note n="(t)" place="margin">In the Article of Faith.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:176665:199"/> as it were commanded by the chief and principall cause.

For if there had bene any man in any of these former or ensuing Ages, professing the Protestants or Puritans Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, assuredly some history-writer had made mention of him by way of prayse or disprayse, since other men and matter of lesse moment, haue bene recorded and noted by history-writers. The reason of this any petition is. Since God hath appoynted Pastours to be alwayes in the true Church &amp; Religion vnto the worlds end, that men should be preserued from wauering in Fayth, and from being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed about with euery wind of false doctrine; If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants cannot name me, no not one man of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion who was in these two former, or ensuing Ages, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coming of Luther; it followeth of necessity that their Religion is nothing else, but a new inuention of Luther &amp; Caluin, and a rapsody or rable of ragged heretikes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Ministers will reply that the Apostles were of their Religiō: I answere first, that I haue refuted before that foolish saying at lēgth, &amp; they cannot produce no not one place of all the Apostles writs, wherby in playne termes, expresse wordes and formal text, they shall be able to proue any debatable poynt of their Religion, or improue any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batable poynt of our Catholik Religion. 2. I answer, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:176665:202"/> all the heretikes who be now a dayes differing amongst themselues in essentiall poynts, as Lutheranes, Caluinists, Anabaptists, Zuynglians, Vbiquitists, Trinitaryes, &amp; such infinite number, they say all that they are of the Apostles Religion, deceauing therby the simple people, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning notwithstanding one another of manifest heresie and diabolicall Idolatry. 3. I answere that it is in question and debate betwixt vs and the Protestants, whether they be of the Apostles Religion, wherfore ignorantly and beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they presuppose which is in question. That which I aske then of M. Ramsey is, that he will name me any wryter of these two former Ages, setting downe his wordes &amp; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as I haue done, who being after the Apostles imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, or mediatly, hath made mention of any debatable poynt of this Religion, as professing the same, and consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him in that vnity of Fayth, which is required to true Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To the better vnderstanding of the which petition of mine it is to be remarked:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Vincēt. Lyrin. lib. contra hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. cap <hi>32.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>That the Church of God is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reful keeper of true Religiō, which is cōmitted to her charge, for she neuer changeth or altereth it in any thing: she diminisheth nothing, nothing she addeth, because God promised that</hi>

                        <hi>the spirit of truth should teach all truth vnto the Church.</hi> Wherfore since that all the holy Fathers named in these two former Ages, and to be named in the ensuing Ages, did constantly belieue, that the true Church of God was euer to continue, that she should not erre in matters of Fayth, that all truth in her was to be foūd as in a rich Treasure house: They in lyke manner did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue constātly, <hi>fide saltem implicita,</hi> whatsoeuer then &amp; now the Catholike Church doth teach and professe: they did all say with holy Irenaeus:<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                        <hi>We must heare and obey that Church, those Priests, who haue succession of their Episcopall function, haue receaued the Charisma of truth.</hi> And forasmuch as these former &amp; ensuing holy Pastours were euer ready to submit their particular opinions to the Fayth and Iudgement of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y Church, to imbrace that as a poynt of Fayth which the Church taught and resolued; neither can particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or errour of some of them hinder their vnity in Fayth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:176665:202"/> with vs, nor yet can we be sayd to belieue any thing, which they belieued not: because they euer submitted their iudgement to the iudgement of the true Church, which then was visible, &amp; which was euer to continue. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise all heretikes which hath bene and be, as they would neuer submit their iudgement to any Church, which then was, or now is, hauing alwayes for the last ground of their Religion, <hi>Their owne particular, and inward spirit, and persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as they haue not, nor euer had any vnity in Fayth; so euery one condemneth another of heresy, of errour and infidelity.

                        <hi>Those</hi> (sayth he) <hi>who in the Church of Christ do hold some vnsound and peruerse opinions, if beyng admonished to come to wholesome and right beliefe, they resist contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciously, and will not amend, but do persist to defend their pestilent and deadly doctrines, they are made heretike.</hi> The same sayth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigē:<note n="(e)" place="margin">In cap. <hi>3</hi> ad Titū. apud Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog. prae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fat.

                        <hi>That man is to be accompted an heretike, who professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to belieue Christ, and yet belieueth something which is different from that, which the definition of Ecclesiasticall tradition conteyneth.</hi> And Beza himselfe, though a Puritane:<note n="(f)" place="margin">Beza in notis super Act. <hi>5.</hi> v. <hi>17.</hi>

                        <hi>He is an hertike who doth so go away from wholesome doctrine, as condemning God, and the iudgement of the Church, persisteth in his opinion and violateth the concord of the Church.</hi> Because pertinacy, which is proper to all heretikes consisteth in holding opinions contrary to the knowne opinion of the Church of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Finally, as I haue set downe in these two former Ages manifestly the beliefe and Religion of the Catholike Roman Church, so the Protestants themselues do auow that the Roman Church the first six hundreth yeares was the only true Church; confirming therby in generall all which I haue set down in particular. Thus Whitaker a prim Minister:<note n="(g)" place="margin">Lib. de Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto cont. Sanderum pag. <hi>35.</hi> &amp; sequent.</note>
                        <hi>The Roman Church,</hi> sayth he, <hi>during the first six hundreth yeares after Christ, was pure and flourishing, and inuiolably taught, and defended the Fayth deliuered by the Apostles.</hi> Which purity of the Roman Church gaue occasion to Tertullian to prouoke the Heretikes of his tyme with the succession of the Bishops of Rome, and the Roman Church:<note n="(h)" place="margin">In his confutatiō of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pag. <hi>374.</hi>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:176665:203"/> Tertullians dayes, that Fayth which it did first receaue from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi> The which tyme he extendeth not only to Irenaeus Cyprian, Tertullian, and Optatus tyme and Age; but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise to S.

                        </note>
                        <hi>That those men specially named the Church of Rome, it was because the Church of Rome at that time, as it was founded by the Apostles, so it continued in the doctrine of the Apostles.</hi> And Caluin himselfe:<note n="(k)" place="margin">Caluin in his French In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stittutions anno <hi>1562.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>It was a thing notorious, &amp; without doubt, that after the Apostles Age, vntill the tyme of those holy Fathers</hi> (that is, of S. Augustine, S. Chrysostome &amp;c.) <hi>who were</hi> 440. <hi>yeares after Christ, no change was made in doctrine, neyther at Rome, nor at other cittyes:</hi> which verity sundry other Protestants accordingly do teach. If thē the Roman Church, faith and religion was only the true religion the first four hundreth yeares, much more the first two hundreth yeares. Which doctrine of two hundreth or foure hundreth yeares is the selfe same for which we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks are now persecuted in England Scotland &amp; Irland as is notorious, and which hath continued from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to our dayes without any interruption at all; and for the which our Blessed Queene Mary, his Highnesse dearest &amp; most holy mother, the last of fourscore Catholike Kings and Queenes of Scotland, suffered martyrdome. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, deare Countreymen, let vs loue our Lord and God, but let vs loue also this his Church: him as our Father, her as our mother: for he who hath not the Catholike and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church for his Mother, assuredly shall neuer haue God of heauen for his Father.</p>
